    "Title": "Tackling Challenges of Neural Purchase Stage Identification from Imbalanced Twitter Data",
    "Abstract": "Twitter and other social media platforms are often used for sharing interest in products. The identification of purchase decision stages, such as in the AIDA model (Awareness, Interest, Desire, Action),  can enable more personalized e-commerce services and a finer-grained targeting of ads than predicting purchase intent only.\r\nIn this paper, we propose and analyze neural models for identifying the purchase stage of single tweets in a user's tweet sequence. In particular, we identify three challenges of purchase stage identification: imbalanced label distribution with a high number of negative instances, limited amount of training data, and domain adaptation with no or only little target domain data.\r\n\r\nOur experiments reveal that the imbalanced label distribution is the main challenge for our models. We address it with ranking loss and perform detailed investigations of the performance of our models on the different output classes. In order to improve the generalization of the models and augment the limited  amount of training data, we examine the use of sentiment analysis as a complementary, secondary task in a multitask framework. For applying our models to tweets from another product domain, we consider two scenarios: For the first scenario without any labeled data in the target product domain, we show that learning domain-invariant representations with adversarial training is most promising while for the second scenario with a small number of labeled target examples, finetuning the source model weights performs best.\r\n\r\nFinally, we conduct several analyses, including extracting attention weights and representative phrases for the different purchase stages. The results suggest that the model is learning features indicative of purchase stages and that the confusion errors are sensible.",

    "Title": "Indoor Localization Techniques for Enhancing IoT Applications in Social Contexts and Processes",
    "Abstract": "An important capability of most smart, Internet-of-Things-enabled spaces (e.g., office, home, hospital, factory) is the ability to leverage context of use. This can support social awareness, allowing people to interact more effectively which each other. Location is a key context element; particularly indoor location. Recent advances in radio ranging technologies, such as 802.11-2016 FTM, promise the availability of low-cost, near-ubiquitous time-of-flight-based ranging estimates. In this paper, we build on prior work to enhance this ranging technology's ability to provide useful location estimates. For further improvements, we model user-motion behavior to estimate the user motion state by taking the temporal measurements available from time-of-flight ranging. We select the velocity parameter of a particle-filter-based on this motion state. We demonstrate meaningful improvements in coordinate-based estimation accuracy and substantial increases in room-level estimation accuracy. Furthermore, insights gained in our real-world deployment provides important implications for future Internet of Things context applications and their supporting technology deployments such as social interaction, workflow management, inventory control, or healthcare information tools.",

    "Abstract": "While it is often critical for indoor-location- and proximity-aware applications to know whether a user is in a space or not (e.g., a specific room or office), a key challenge is that the difference between standing on one side or another of a doorway or wall is well within the error range of most RF-based approaches. In this work, we address this challenge by augmenting RF-based localization and proximity detection with active ultrasonic sensing, taking advantage of the limited propagation of sound waves. This simple and cost-effective approach can allow, for example, a Bluetooth smart-lock to discern whether a user is inside or outside their home. We describe a configurable architecture for our solution and present experiments that validate this approach but also demonstrate that different user behavior and application needs can impact system configuration decisions. Finally, we describe applications that could benefit from our solution and address privacy concerns.",

    "Abstract": "This paper reports our explorations on learning Sensory Media Association through Reciprocating Training (SMART). The proposed learning system contains two deep autoencoders, one for learning speech representations and another for learning image representations. Two deep networks are trained to bridge the latent spaces of two autoencoders, yielding representation mappings for both speech-to-image and image-to-speech. To improve feature clustering in both latent spaces, the system alternately uses one modality to guide the learning of another modality. Different from traditional technology that uses a fixed modality for supervision (e.g. using text labels for image classification), the proposed approach facilitates a machine to learn from sensory data of two or more modalities through alternating guidance among these modalities. We evaluate the proposed model with MNIST digit images and corresponding digit speeches in the Google Command Digit Dataset (GCDD). We also evaluate the model with a dataset based on COIL-100 and corresponding Watson synthesized speech. The results demonstrate the model's promising viability for sensory media association.",

    "Abstract": "We present a remote assistance system that enables a remotely located expert to provide guidance using hand gestures to a customer who performs a physical task in a different location. The system is built on top of a web-based real-time media communication framework which allows the customer to use a commodity smartphone to send a live video feed to the expert, from which the expert can see the view of the customer's workspace and can show his/her hand gestures over the video in real-time. The expert's hand gesture is captured with a hand tracking device and visualized with a rigged 3D hand model on the live video feed. The system can be accessed via a web browser, and it does not require any app software to be installed on the customer's device. Our system supports various types of devices including smartphone, tablet, desktop PC, and smart glass. To improve the collaboration experience, the system provides a novel gravity-aware hand visualization technique. ",

    "Abstract": "In a telepresence scenario with remote users discussing a document, it can be difficult to follow which parts are being discussed.  One way to address this is by showing the user's hand position on the document, which also enables expressive gestural communication. An important practical problem is how to capture and transmit the hand movements efficiently with high resolution document images. We propose a tabletop system with two channels that integrates document capture with a 4K video camera and hand tracking with a webcam, in which the document image and hand skeleton data are transmitted at different rates and handled by a lightweight Web browser client at remote sites. To enhance the rendering, we employ velocity based smoothing and ephemeral motion traces. We tested our prototype over long distances from USA to Japan and to Italy, and report on latency and jitter performance. Our system achieves relatively low latency over a long distance in comparison with a tele-immersive system that transmits mesh data over much shorter distances.",

Conducting\r\nweb conferences in these settings creates privacy issues, and can also distract participants, leading to a perceived lack of professionalism from the remote peer(s).\r\nTo solve this common problem, we implemented CamaLeon, a browser-based tool that uses real-time machine vision powered by deep learning to change the webcam stream sent by the remote peer: specifically, CamaLeon dynamically changes the \"wild\" background into one that resembles that of the office workers.\r\nIn order to detect the background in wild settings, we designed and trained a fast UNet model on head and shoulder images. CamaLeon also uses a face detector to determine whether it should stream the person's face, depending on its location (or lack of presence). It uses face recognition to make sure it streams only a face that belongs to the user who connected to the meeting.\r\nThe system was tested during a few real video conferencing calls at our company where 2 workers are remote. Both parties felt a sense of enhanced co-presence, and the remote participants felt more professional with their background replaced.",

This panel will bring together an array of experts who have experience collecting large-scale datasets, building multimedia algorithms, and deploying them in practical applications, as well as, a lawyer whose eyes have been on the fundamental rights at stake. They will lead a discussion on the ethics and lawfulness of dataset creation, licensing, privacy of individuals represented in the datasets, algorithmic transparency, algorithmic bias, explainability, and the implications of application deployment. Through an interactive process engaging the audience, the panel hopes to: increase the awareness of such concepts in the multimedia research community; initiate a discussion on community guidelines all for setting the future direction of conducting multimedia research in a lawful and ethical manner.",

    "Title": "VisTA: Integrating Machine Intelligence with Visualization to Support the Investigation of Think-Aloud Sessions",
    "Abstract": "Think-aloud protocols are widely used by user experience (UX) practitioners in usability testing to uncover issues in user interface design. It is often arduous to analyze large amounts of recorded think-aloud sessions and few UX practitioners have an opportunity to get a second perspective during their analysis due to time and resource constraints. Inspired by the recent research that shows subtle verbalization and speech patterns tend to occur when users encounter usability problems, we take the first step to design and evaluate an intelligent visual analytics tool that leverages such patterns to identify usability problem encounters and present them to UX practitioners to assist their analysis. We first conducted and recorded think-aloud sessions, and then extracted textual and acoustic features from the recordings and trained machine learning (ML) models to detect problem encounters. Next, we iteratively designed and developed a visual analytics tool, VisTA, which enables dynamic investigation of think-aloud sessions with a timeline visualization of ML predictions and input features. We conducted a between-subjects laboratory study to compare three conditions, i.e., VisTA, VisTASimple (no visualization of the ML’s input features), and Baseline (no ML information at all), with 30 UX professionals. The findings show that UX professionals identified more problem encounters when using VisTA than Baseline by leveraging the problem visualization as an overview, anticipations, and anchors as well as the feature visualization as a means to understand what ML considers and omits. Our findings also provide insights into how they treated ML, dealt with (dis)agreement with ML, and reviewed the videos (i.e., play, pause, and rewind).",

    "Title": "Interactive Bicluster Aggregation in Bipartite Graphs",
    "Abstract": "Exploring coordinated relationships is important for sensemaking of data in various fields, such as intelligence analysis. To support such investigations, visual analysis tools use biclustering to mine relationships in bipartite graphs and visualize the resulting biclusters with standard graph visualization techniques. Due to overlaps among biclusters, such visualizations can be cluttered (e.g., with many edge crossings), when there are a large number of biclusters. Prior work attempted to resolve this problem by automatically ordering nodes in a bipartite graph. However, visual clutter is still a serious problem, since the number of displayed biclusters remains unchanged. We propose bicluster aggregation as an alternative approach, and have developed two methods of interactively merging biclusters. These interactive bicluster aggregations help organize similar biclusters and reduce the number of displayed biclusters. Initial expert feedback indicates potential usefulness of these techniques in practice.",

    "Title": "Albireo: An Interactive Tool for Visually Summarizing Computational Notebook Structure",
    "Abstract": "Computational notebooks have become a major medium for data exploration and insight communication in data science. Although expressive, dynamic, and flexible, in practice they are loose collections of scripts, charts, and tables that rarely tell a story or clearly represent the analysis process. This leads to a number of usability issues, particularly in the comprehension and exploration of notebooks. In this work, we design, implement, and evaluate Albireo, a visualization approach to summarize the structure of notebooks, with the goal of supporting more effective exploration and communication by displaying the dependencies and relationships between the cells of a notebook using a dynamic graph structure. We evaluate the system via a case study and expert interviews, with our results indicating that such a visualization is useful for an analyst’s self-reflection during exploratory programming, and also effective for communication of narratives and collaboration between analysts.",

One important task is missing link prediction, which infers the existence of unseen links based on currently observed ones. In this paper, we propose MissBiN that involves analysts in the loop for making sense of link prediction results. MissBiN combines a novel method for link prediction and an interactive visualization for examining and understanding the algorithm outputs. Further, we conducted quantitative experiments to assess the performance of the proposed link prediction algorithm, and a case study to evaluate the overall effectiveness of MissBiN.",

    "Abstract": "Localization in an indoor and/or Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied environment is paramount to drive various applications that require locating humans and/or robots in an unknown environment. Various localization systems using different ubiquitous sensors such as camera, radio frequency, inertial measurement unit have been developed. Most of these systems cannot accommodate for scenarios which have substan- tial changes in the environment such as a large number of people (unpredictable) and sudden change in the environment floor plan (unstructured). In this paper, we propose a system, InFo that can leverage real-time visual information captured by surveillance cameras and augment that with images captured by the smart device user to deliver accurate discretized location information. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our deep learning based InFo system provides an improvement of 10% as compared to a system that does not utilize this real-time information.",

    "Abstract": "Human activity forecasting from videos in routine-based tasks is an open research problem that has numerous applications in robotics, visual monitoring and skill  assessment. Currently,  many challenges  exist in activity forecasting because human actions are not fully observable from continuous recording. Additionally, a large number of human activities involve fine-grained articulated human motions that are  hard to capture using frame-level representations. To overcome thesechallenges, we propose a method that  forecasts human actions by learning the dynamics of local motion patterns extracted  from dense trajectories using longshort-term memory (LSTM). The experiments on a pub-lic dataset validated the effectiveness of our proposed method in activity forecasting and demonstrate large improvements over the baseline two stream end-to-endmodel. We also learnt that human activity forecasting benefits from learning both the short-range motion pat-terns and long-term dependencies between actions.",

This paper examines techniques for adapting from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain in the context of an encoder-decoder model for text generation. In addition to adversarial domain adaptation (ADA), we introduce the use of artificial titles and sequential training to capture the grammatical style of the unlabeled target domain. Evaluation on adapting to/from news articles and Stack Exchange posts indicates that the use of these techniques can boost performance for both unsupervised adaptation as well as fine-tuning with limited target data.",

For example, those telecommunication systems cannot allow remote users to move pieces of a board game while playing with a local user. We propose that installing a robot arm and teleoperating it can address the problem by enabling remote physical interaction. We compare three methods for remote control to study the relationship between connection, and how it relates to agency and autonomy for each control scheme.\r\n",

    "Title": "OPaPi: Optimized Parts Pick-up routing for efficient manufacturing",
    "Abstract": "Manufacturing environments require changes in work procedures and settings based on changes in product demand affecting the types of products for production. Resource re-organization and time needed for worker adaptation to such frequent changes can be expensive. For example, for each change, managers in a factory may be required to manually create a list of inventory items to be picked up by workers. Uncertainty in predicting the appropriate pick-up time due to differences in worker-determined routes may make it difficult for managers to generate a fixed schedule for delivery to the assembly line. To address these problems, we propose OPaPi, a human-centric system that improves the efficiency of manufacturing by optimizing parts pick-up routes and schedules. OPaPi leverages frequent pattern mining and the traveling salesman problem solver to suggest rack placement for more efficient routes. The system further employs interactive visualization to incorporate an expert’s domain knowledge and\r\ndifferent manufacturing constraints for real-time adaptive decision making.",

    "Abstract": "As our landscape of wearable technologies proliferates, we find more devices situated on our heads. However, many challenges hinder them from widespread adoption---from their awkward, bulky form factor (today's AR and VR goggles) to their socially stigmatized designs (Google Glass) and a lack of a well-developed head-based interaction design language. In this paper, we explore a socially acceptable, large, head-worn interactive wearable---a hat. We report results from a gesture elicitation study with 17 participants, extract a taxonomy of gestures, and define a set of design concerns for interactive hats. Through this lens, we detail the design and fabrication of three hat prototypes capable of sensing touch, head movements, and gestures, and including ambient displays of several types. Finally, we report an evaluation of our hat prototype and insights to inform the design of future hat technologies. ",

In the case of video conferencing, 360° cameras provide almost unrestricted visibility into a conference room for a remote viewer without the need for an articulating camera.

To address this, we fabricated a prototype device that shows the gaze and presence of remote 360° viewers using a ring of LEDs that match the remote viewports. We discuss the long term use of one of the prototypes in a lecture hall and present future directions for visualizing gaze presence in 360° video streams.",

    "Abstract": "In multi-participant postings, as in online chat conversations, several conversations or topic threads may take place concurrently. This leads to difficulties for readers reviewing the postings in not only following discussions but also in quickly identifying their essence. A two-step process, disentanglement of interleaved posts followed by summarization of each thread, addresses the issue, but disentanglement errors are propagated to the summarization step, degrading the overall performance. To address this, we propose an end-to-end trainable encoder-decoder network for summarizing interleaved posts. The interleaved posts are encoded hierarchically, i.e., word-to-word (words in a post) followed by post-to-post (posts in a channel). The decoder also generates summaries hierarchically, thread-to-thread (generate thread representations) followed by word-to-word (i.e., generate summary words). Additionally, we propose a hierarchical attention mechanism for interleaved text. Overall, our end-to-end trainable hierarchical framework enhances performance over a sequence to sequence framework by 8\\% on a synthetic interleaved texts dataset.",

Much progress has been made on the development of accurate of indoor location systems, which form the foundation of many interesting applications, particularly in consumer scenarios. However, many location-based applications in enterprise settings also require addressing another facet of reliability: assurance. Without having strong guarantees of a location estimate’s legitimacy, stakeholders must explicitly balance the advantages offered with the risks of falsification. In this space, there are two key threats: replay attacks, where signal and sensor information is collected in one location and replayed in another to falsify a location estimation later in time; and wormhole attacks, where signal and sensor information is forwarded to a remote location by a colluding device to falsify location estimation in real-time. In this work, we improve upon the state of the art in wormhole-resistant location estimation techniques. Specifically, we present the Location Anchor, which leverages a combination of technical solutions and social contracts to provide high-assurance proofs of device location that are resistant to wormhole attacks. Unlike existing work, the Location Anchor has minimal hardware costs, supports a rich tapestry of applications, and is compatible with commodity smartphone and tablet platforms. We show that the Location Anchor can extend existing replay-resistant location systems into wormhole-resistant location systems, even in the face of very aggressive attacker assumptions. We describe the protocols underlying the Location Anchor, as well as report on the efficacy of a prototype implementation.",

    "Abstract": "Work breaks -- both physical and digital -- play an important role in productivity and workplace wellbeing. Yet, the growing availability of digital distractions from online content can turn breaks into prolonged \"cyberloafing\". In this paper, we present UpTime, a system that aims to support workers' transitions from breaks back to work--moments susceptible to digital distractions. Combining a browser extension and chatbot, users interact with UpTime through proactive and reactive chat prompts. By sensing transitions from inactivity, UpTime helps workers avoid distractions by automatically blocking distracting websites temporarily, while still giving them control to take necessary digital breaks. We report findings from a 3-week comparative field study with 15 workers. Our results show that automatic, temporary blocking at transition points can significantly reduce digital distractions and stress without sacrificing workers' sense of control. Our findings, however, also emphasize that overloading users' existing communication channels for chatbot interaction should be done thoughtfully.",

    "Abstract": "Recent advances on the Internet of Things (IoT) lead to an explosion of physical objects being connected to the Internet. These objects sense, compute, interpret what is occurring within themselves and the world, and preferably interact with users. In this work, we present a visible light-enabled finger tracking technique allowing users to perform freestyle multi-touch gestures on everyday object’s surface. By projecting encoded patterns onto an object’s surface (e.g. paper, display, or table) through a projector, and localizing the user’s fingers with light sensors, the proposed system offers users a richer interactive space than the device’s existing interfaces. More importantly, results from our experiments indicate that this system can localize ten fingers simultaneously with an accuracy of 1.7 millimeters and an refresh rate of 84 Hz with only 31 milliseconds delay on WiFi or 23 milliseconds delay on serial communication, easily supporting multi-finger gesture interaction on everyday ob-jects. We also develop two example applications to demonstrate possible scenarios. Finally, we conduct a pre-liminary exploration of 3D depth inference using the same setup and achieve 2.43 cm depth estimation accuracy.",

    "Abstract": "We present an approach to detect speech impairments from video of people with aphasia, a neurological condition that affects the ability to comprehend and produce speech. To counter inherent privacy issues, we propose a cross-media approach using only visual facial features to detect speech properties without listening to the audio content of speech. Our method uses facial landmark detections to measure facial motion over time. We show how to detect speech and pause instances based on temporal mouth shape analysis and identify repeating mouth patterns using a dynamic warping mechanism. We relate our developed features for pause frequency, mouth pattern repetitions, and pattern variety to actual symptoms of people with aphasia in the AphasiaBank dataset. Our evaluation shows that our developed features are able to reliably differentiate dysfluent speech production of people with aphasia from those without aphasia with an accuracy of 0.86. A combination of these handcrafted features and further statistical measures on talking and repetition improves classification performance to an accuracy of 0.88.",

    "Abstract": "Activity recognition is a core component of many intelligent and context-aware systems. We present a solution for discreetly and unobtrusively recognizing common work activities above a work surface without using cameras.We demonstrate our approach, which utilizes an RF-radar sensor mounted under the work surface, in three domains; recognizing work activities at a convenience-store counter, recognizing common office deskwork activities, and estimating the position of customers in a showroom environment. Our examples illustrate potential benefits for both post-hoc business analytics and for real-time applications. Our solution was able to classify seven clerk activities with 94.9% accuracy using data collected in a lab environment and able to recognize six common deskwork activities collected in real offices with 95.3% accuracy. Using two sensors simultaneously, we demonstrate coarse position estimation around a large surface with 95.4% accuracy. We show that using multiple projections of RF signal leads to improved recognition accuracy. Finally, we show how smartwatches worn by users can be used to attribute an activity, recognized with the RF sensor, to a particular user in multi-user scenarios. We believe our solution can mitigate some of users’ privacy concerns associated with cameras and is useful for a wide range of intelligent systems.",

In this work, we propose a new recognizer that employs a deep neural net with an RGB-D camera; specifically, we use a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with optical flow computed from the color and depth channels.

In social media, users can vote, share, or bookmark a post they prefer. The number of these actions is regarded as a measure of popularity. However, popularity is not solely determined by content of a post, e.g., a text or an image in a post, but is highly contaminated by its contexts, e.g., timing, and authority. We propose a disjunctive model, which computes the contribution of content and context separately. For evaluation, we build a dataset where the informativeness of a comment is annotated. We evaluate the results with ranking metrics, and show that our model outperforms the baseline model, which directly uses popularity as a measure of informativeness.",

    "Abstract": "Prewriting is the process of generating and organizing ideas before drafting a document. Although often overlooked by novice writers and writing tool developers, prewriting is a critical process that improves the quality of a final document. To better understand current prewriting practices, we first conducted interviews with writing learners and experts. Based on the learners’ needs and experts’ recommendations, we then designed and developed InkPlanner, a novel pen and touch visualization tool that allows writers to utilize visual diagramming for ideation during prewriting. InkPlanner further allows writers to sort their ideas into a logical and sequential narrative by using a novel widget— NarrativeLine. Using a NarrativeLine, InkPlanner can automatically generate a document outline to guide later drafting exercises. Inkplanner is powered by machine-generated semantic and structural suggestions that are curated from various texts. To qualitatively review the tool and understand how writers use InkPlanner for prewriting, two writing experts were interviewed and a user study was conducted with university students. The results demonstrated that InkPlanner encouraged writers to generate more diverse ideas and also enabled them to think more strategically about how to organize their ideas for later drafting.",

    "Abstract": "With the tremendous progress in sensing and IoT infrastructure, it is foreseeable that IoT systems will soon be available for commercial markets, such as in people's homes. In this paper, we present a deployment study using sensors attached to household objects to capture the resourcefulness of three individuals. The concept of resourcefulness \r\nhighlights the ability of humans to repurpose objects spontaneously for a different use case than was initially intended. It is a crucial element for human health and wellbeing, which is of great interest for various aspects of HCI and design research. Traditionally, resourcefulness is captured through ethnographic practice. Ethnography can only provide sparse and often short duration observations of human experience, often relying on participants being aware of and remembering behaviours or thoughts they need to report on. Our hypothesis is that resourcefulness can also be captured through continuously monitoring objects being used in everyday life. We developed a system that can record object movement continuously and deployed them in homes of three elderly people for over two weeks. We explored the use of probabilistic topic models to analyze the collected data and identify common patterns.",

    "Title": "TeamSense: Assessing Personal Affect and Group Cohesion in Small Teams Through Dyadic Interaction and Behavior Analysis with Wearable Sensors",
    "Abstract": "Continuous monitoring with unobtrusive wearable social sensors is becoming a popular method to assess individual affect states and team effectiveness in human research. A large number of applications have demonstrated the effectiveness of applying wearable sensing in corporate settings; for example, in short periodic social events or in a university campus. However, little is known of how we can automatically detect individual affect and group cohesion for long duration missions. Predicting negative affect states and low cohesiveness is vital for team missions. Knowing team members’ negative states allows timely interventions to enhance their effectiveness. This work investigates whether sensing social interactions and individual behaviors with wearable sensors can provide insights into assessing individual affect states and group cohesion. We analyzed wearable sensor data from a team of six crew members who were deployed on a four-month simulation of a space exploration mission at a remote location. Our work proposes to recognize team members’ affect states and group cohesion as a binary classification problem using novel behavior features that represent dyadic interaction and individual activities. Our method aggregates features from individual members into group levels to predict team cohesion. Our results show that the behavior features extracted from the wearable social sensors provide useful information in assessing personal affect and team cohesion. Group task cohesion can be predicted with a high performance of over 0.8 AUC. Our work demonstrates that we can extract social interactions from sensor data to predict group cohesion in longitudinal missions. We found that quantifying behavior patterns including dyadic interactions and face-to-face communications are important in assessing team process.",

We then combine these questions into a set of 25 reflective mini-dialogues. We deliver our mini-dialogues through MMS. 33 active users of fitness trackers used our system in a 2-week field deployment. Results suggest that the mini-dialogues were successful in triggering reflection and that this reflection led to increases in motivation, empowerment, and adoption of new behaviors. Encouragingly, 16 participants elected to use the system for two additional weeks without compensation. We present implications for the design of technology-supported dialog system for reflection.",

    "Title": "Fusing Map Information with a Probabilistic Sensor\r\nModel for Indoor Localization using RF Beacons",
    "Abstract": "Accurate localization is a fundamental requirement for a variety of applications, ranging from industrial robot operations to location-powered applications on mobile devices. A key technical challenge in achieving this goal is providing a clean and reliable estimation of location from a variety of low-cost, uncalibrated sesnors. Many current techniques rely on Particle Filter (PF) based algorithms. They have proven successful at effectively fusing various sensors inputs to create meaningful location predictions. In this paper we build upon this large corpous of work. Like prior work, our technique fuses Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons with map information. A key contribution of our work is a new sensor model for BLE beacons that does not require the mapping from RSSI to distance. We further contribute a novel method of utilizing map information during the initialization of the system and during the resampling phase when new particles are generated. Using our proposed sensor model and map prior information the performance of the overall localization is improved by 1.20 m on comparing the 75th percentile of the cumulative distribution with traditional localization techniques.",

    "Title": "A Radio-Inertial Localization and Tracking System with BLE\r\nBeacons Prior Maps",
    "Abstract": "In this paper, we develop a system for the lowcost indoor localization and tracking problem using radio signal strength indicator, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and magnetometer sensors. We develop a novel and simplified probabilistic IMU motion model as the proposal distribution of the sequential Monte-Carlo technique to track the robot trajectory. Our algorithm can globally localize and track a robot with a priori unknown location, given an informative prior map of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. Also, we formulate the problem as an optimization problem that serves as the Backend of the algorithm mentioned above (Front-end). Thus, by simultaneously solving for the robot trajectory and the map of BLE beacons, we recover a continuous and smooth trajectory of the robot, corrected locations of the BLE beacons, and the time varying IMU bias. The evaluations achieved using hardware show that through the proposed closed-loop system the localization performance can be improved; furthermore, the system becomes robust to the error in the map of beacons by feeding back the optimized map to the Front-end.",

    "Abstract": "In this chapter we discuss the use of external sources of data in designing conversational dialogues. We focus on applications in behavior change around physical activity involving dialogues that help users better understand their self-tracking data and motivate healthy behaviors. We start by introducing the areas of behavior change and personal informatics and discussing the importance of self-tracking data in these areas. We then introduce the role of reflective dialogue-based counseling systems in this domain, discuss specific value that self-tracking data can bring, and how it can be used in creating the dialogues. The core of the chapter focuses on six practical examples of design of dialogues involving self-tracking data that we either tested in our research or propose as future directions based on our experiences. We end the chapter by discussing how the design principles for involving external data in conversations can be applied to broader domains. Our goal for this chapter is to share our experiences, outline design principles, highlight several design opportunities in external data-driven computer-based conversations, and encourage the reader to explore creative ways of involving external sources of data in shaping dialogues-based interactions.",

    "Abstract": "Historically, people have interacted with companies and institutions through telephone-based dialogue systems and paper-based forms. Now, these interactions are rapidly moving to web- and phone-based chat systems. While converting traditional telephone dialogues to chat is relatively straightforward, converting forms to conversational interfaces can be challenging. In this work, we introduce methods and interfaces to enable the conversion of PDF and web-based documents that solicit user input into chat-based dialogues. Document data is first extracted to associate fields and their textual descriptions using meta-data and lightweight visual analysis. The field labels, their spatial layout, and associated text are further analyzed to group related fields into natural conversational units. These correspond to questions presented to users in chat interfaces to solicit information needed to complete the original documents and downstream processes they support. This user supplied data can be inserted into the source documents and/or in downstream databases. User studies of our tool show that it streamlines form-to-chat conversion and produces conversational dialogues of at least the same quality as a purely manual approach.",

    "Title": "SlideDiff: Animating Textual and Media Changes in Slides",
    "Abstract": "SlideDiff is a system that automatically creates an animated rendering of textual and media differences between two versions of a slide. While previous work focuses either on textual or image data, SlideDiff integrates text and media changes, as well as their interactions, e.g. adding an image forces nearby text boxes to shrink. Provided with two versions of a slide (not the full history of edits), SlideDiff detects the textual and image differences, and then animates the changes by mimicking what a user would have done, such as moving the cursor, typing text, resizing image boxes, adding images. This editing metaphor is well known to most users, helping them better understand what has changed, and fosters a sense of connection between remote workers, making them feel as if we edited together. After detection of text and image differences, the animations are rendered in HTML and CSS, including mouse cursor motion, text and image box selection and resizing, text deletion and insertion with its cursor. We discuss strategies for animating changes, in particular the importance of starting with large changes and finishing with smaller edits, and provide evidence of the utility of SlideDiff in a workplace setting.",

The system monitors photocopiers to detect the copying of pages from copyrighted publications. Such activity is tallied for billing purposes. Access rights to the materials can be checked to prevent printing. Digital images of the copied pages are checked against a database of copyrighted pages. To preserve the privacy of the copying of non-copyright materials, only digital fingerprints are submitted to the image matching service. A problem with such systems is creation of the database of copyright pages. To facilitate this, our system maintains statistics of clusters of similar unknown page images along with copy sequence. Once such a cluster has grown to a sufficient size, a human inspector can determine whether those page sequences are copyrighted. The system has been tested with 100,000s of pages from conference proceedings and with millions of randomly generated pages. Retrieval accuracy has been around 99% even with copies of copies or double-page copies.",

    "Title": "The Effect of Edge Bundling and Seriation on Sensemaking of Biclusters in Bipartite Graphs",
    "Abstract": "Exploring coordinated relationships (e.g., shared relationships between two sets of entities) is an important analytics task in a variety of real-world applications, such as discovering similarly behaved genes in bioinformatics, detecting malware collusions in cyber security, and identifying products bundles in marketing analysis. Coordinated relationships can be formalized as biclusters. In order to support visual exploration of biclusters, bipartite graphs based visualizations have been proposed, and edge bundling is used to show biclusters. However, it suffers from edge crossings due to possible overlaps of biclusters, and lacks in-depth understanding of its impact on user exploring biclusters in bipartite graphs. To address these, we propose a novel bicluster-based seriation technique that can reduce edge crossings in bipartite graphs drawing and conducted a user experiment to study the effect of edge bundling and this proposed technique on visualizing biclusters in bipartite graphs. We found that they both had impact on reducing entity visits for users exploring biclusters, and edge bundles helped them find more justified answers. Moreover, we identified four key trade-offs that inform the design of future bicluster visualizations. The study results suggest that edge bundling is critical for exploring biclusters in bipartite graphs, which helps to reduce low-level perceptual problems and support high-level inferences.",

    "Title": "Sensing or Watching? Balancing Utility and Privacy in Sensing Systems via Collection and Enforcement Mechanisms",
    "Abstract": "Devices with embedded sensors are permeating the computing landscape, allowing the collection and analysis of rich data about individuals, smart spaces, and their interactions. This class of de- vices enables a useful array of home automation and connected workplace functionality to individuals within instrumented spaces. Unfortunately, the increasing pervasiveness of sensors can lead to perceptions of privacy loss by their occupants. Given that many instrumented spaces exist as platforms outside of a user’s control—e.g., IoT sensors in the home that rely on cloud infrastructure or connected workplaces managed by one’s employer—enforcing access controls via a trusted reference monitor may do little to assuage individuals’ privacy concerns. This calls for novel enforcement mechanisms for controlling access to sensed data.\r\nIn this paper, we investigate the interplay between sensor fidelity and individual comfort, with the goal of understanding the design space for effective, yet palatable, sensors for the workplace. In the context of a common space contextualization task, we survey and interview individuals about their comfort with three common sensing modalities: video, audio, and passive infrared. This allows us to explore the extent to which discomfort with sensor platforms is a function of detected states or sensed data. Our findings uncover interesting interplays between content, context, fidelity, history, and privacy. This, in turn, leads to design recommendations regarding how to increase comfort with sensing technologies by revisiting the mechanisms by which user preferences and policies are enforced in situations where the infrastructure itself is not trusted.",

A Siamese Hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (SHCNN), which integrates local and more global representations of a message, is first presented to estimate the conversation-level similarity between closely posted messages. With the estimated similarity scores, our algorithm for Conversation Identification by SImilarity Ranking (CISIR) then derives conversations based on high-confidence message pairs and pairwise redundancy.\r\nExperiments were conducted with four publicly available datasets of conversations from Reddit and IRC channels. The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms comparative baselines in both pairwise similarity estimation and conversation disentanglement.",

    "Abstract": "Conversational agents stand to play an important role in supporting behavior change and well-being in many domains. With users able to interact with conversational agents through both text and voice, understanding how designing for these channels supports behavior change is important. To begin answering this question, we designed a conversational agent for the workplace that supports workers’ activity-journaling and self-learning through reflection. Our agent, named Robota, combines chat-based communication as a Slack Bot and voice interaction through a personal device using a custom Amazon Alexa Skill. Through a 3-week controlled deployment, we examine how voice-based and chat-based interaction affect workers’ reflection and support self-learning. We demonstrate that, while many current technical limitations exist, adding dedicated mobile voice interaction separate from the already busy chat modality may further enable users to step back and reflect on their work. We conclude with discussion of the implications of our findings to design of workplace self-tracking systems specifically and to behavior-change systems in general.",

Most of the work to date has either focused on reducing the dimensionality of data for better learning of parameters during training or on developing different variations of CNN models to improve pose estimation. Many of the best performing works solely consider the content in a single image, while the context from historical images is ignored. In this paper, we propose a combined CNN-LSTM which is capable of incorporating contextual information from historical images to better estimate the current pose. Experimental results achieved using a dataset collected in an indoor office space improved the overall system results to 0.8 m & 2.5° at the third quartile of the cumulative distribution as compared with 1.5 m & 3.0° achieved by PoseNet [1]. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the temporal information exploited by the CNN-LSTM model assists in localizing the robot in situations where image content does not have sufficient features.",

In this paper, we extend current research on workplace communication and uncover opportunities for technology to support effective work activity reporting. We report on three studies: With a survey of 68 knowledge workers followed by 14 in-depth interviews, we investigated the perceived benefits of different types of progress reports and an array of challenges at three stages: Collection, Composition, and Delivery. We show an important interplay between written and face-to-face reporting, and highlight the importance of tailoring a report to its audience. We then present results from an analysis of 722 reports composed by 361 U.S.-based knowledge workers, looking at the influence of the audience on a report’s language. We conclude by discussing opportunities for future technologies to assist both employees and managers in collecting, interpreting, and reporting progress in the workplace.\r\n\r\n",

MOOCex is also equipped with interactive visualization allowing learners to explore the semantic space of recommendations within their current learning context. The results of comparisons to traditional methods, including content-based recommendation and ranked list representation, indicate the effectiveness of MOOCex. Further, feedback from MOOC learners and instructors suggests that MOOCex enhances both MOOC-based learning and teaching.",

    "Abstract": "Understanding team communication and collaboration patterns is critical for improving work efficiency in organizations. This paper presents an interactive visualization system, T-Cal, that supports the analysis of conversation data from modern team messaging platforms (e.g., Slack). T-Cal employs a user-familiar visual interface, a calendar, to enable seamless multi-scale browsing of data from different perspectives. T-Cal also incorporates a number of analytical techniques for disentangling interleaving conversations, extracting keywords, and estimating sentiment. The design of T-Cal is based on an iterative user-centered design process including field studies, requirements gathering, initial prototypes demonstration, and evaluation with domain users. The resulting two case studies indicate the effectiveness and usefulness of T-Cal in real-world applications, including student group chats during a MOOC and daily conversations within an industry research lab.",

    "Abstract": "Activity recognition is a core component of many intelligent and context-aware systems. In this paper, we present a solution for discreetly and unobtrusively recognizing common work activities above a work surface without using cameras. We demonstrate our approach, which utilizes an RF-radar sensor mounted under the work surface, in two work domains; recognizing work activities at a convenience-store counter (useful for post-hoc analytics) and recognizing common office deskwork activities (useful for real-time applications). We classify seven clerk activities with 94.9% accuracy using data collected in a lab environment, and recognize six common deskwork activities collected in real offices with 95.3% accuracy. We show that using multiple projections of RF signal leads to improved recognition accuracy. Finally, we show how smartwatches worn by users can be used to attribute an activity, recognized with the RF sensor, to a particular user in multi-user scenarios. We believe our solution can mitigate some of users’ privacy concerns associated with cameras and is useful for a wide range of intelligent systems.",

    "Abstract": "This paper examines content-based recommendation in domains exhibiting sequential topical structure. An example is educational video, including Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in which knowledge builds within and across courses. Conventional content-based or collaborative filtering recommendation methods do not exploit courses' sequential nature. We describe a system for video recommendation that combines topic-based video representation with sequential pattern mining of inter-topic relationships. Unsupervised topic modeling provides a scalable and domain-independent representation. We mine inter-topic relationships from manually constructed syllabi that instructors provide to guide students through their courses.  This approach also allows the inclusion of multi-video sequences among the recommendation results.\r\nIntegrating the resulting sequential information with content-level similarity provides relevant as well as diversified recommendations. Quantitative evaluation indicates that the proposed system, \\textit{SeqSense}, recommends fewer redundant videos than baseline methods, and instead emphasizes results consistent with mined topic transitions.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional summarization initiatives have been focused on specific types of documents such as articles, reviews, videos, image feeds, or tweets, a practice which may result in pigeonholing the summarization task in the surrounding of modern, content-rich multimedia collections. Consequently, much of the research to date has revolved around mostly toy problems in narrow domains and working on single-source media types. We argue that summarization and story generation systems need to refocus the problem space in order to meet the information needs in the age of user-generated content in different formats and languages. Here we create a framework for flexible multimedia storytelling. Narratives, stories, and summaries carry a set of challenges in big data and dynamic multi-source media that give rise to new research in spatial-temporal representation, viewpoint generation, and explanation.",

    "Title": "Tools for online tutorials: comparing capture devices, tutorial representations, and access devices",
    "Abstract": "Tutorials are one of the most fundamental means of conveying knowledge. Ideally when the task involves physical or digital objects, tutorials not only describe each step with text or via audio narration but show it as well using photos or animation. In most cases, online tutorial authors capture media from handheld mobile devices to compose these documents, but increasingly they use wearable devices as well. In this work, we explore the full life-cycle of online tutorial creation and viewing using head-mounted capture and displays. We developed a media-capture tool for Google Glass that requires minimal attention to the capture device and instead allows the author to focus on creating the tutorial's content rather than its capture. The capture tool is coupled with web-based authoring tools for creating annotatable videos and multimedia documents. In a study comparing standalone (camera on tripod) versus wearable capture (Google Glass) as well as two types of multimedia representation for authoring tutorials (video-based or document-based), we show that tutorial authors have a preference for wearable capture devices, especially when recording activities involving larger objects in non-desktop environments. Authors preferred document-based multimedia tutorials because they are more straightforward to compose and the step-based structure translates more directly to explaining a procedure. In addition, we explored using head-mounted displays (Google Glass) for accessing tutorials in comparison to lightweight computing devices such as tablets. Our study included tutorials recorded with the same capture methods as in our access study. We found that although authors preferred head-mounted capture, tutorial consumers preferred video recorded by a camera on tripod that provides a more stable image of the workspace. Head-mounted displays are good for glanceable information, however video demands more attention and our participants made more errors using Glass than when using a tablet, which was easier to ignore. Our findings point out several design implications for online tutorial authoring and access methods.",

    "Abstract": "Advances in small and low power electronics have created new opportunities for the Internet of Things (IoT), leading to an explosion of physical objects being connected to the Internet. However, there still lacks an indoor localization solution that can answer the needs of various location-based IoT applications with desired simplicity, robustness, accuracy, and responsiveness. We introduce Foglight, a visible light enabled indoor localization system for IoT devices that relies on unique spatial encoding produced when mechanical mirrors inside a projector are flipped based on gray-coded binary images. Foglight employs simple off-the-shelf light sensors that can be easily coupled with existing IoT devices - such as thermometers, gas meters, or light switches - making their location discoverable. Our sensor unit is computation efficient; it can perform high-accuracy localization with minimum signal processing overhead, allowing any low-power IoT device on which it rests to be able to locate itself. Additionally, results from our evaluation reveal that Foglight can locate a target device with an average accuracy of 1.7 millimeters and average refresh rate of 84 Hz with minimal latency, 31.46 milliseconds on WiFi and 23.2 milliseconds on serial communication. Two example applications are developed to demonstrate possible scenarios as proof of concept. We also discuss limitations, how they could be overcome, and propose next steps.",

From the video frames, ink strokes are extracted and used as input to an online handwriting recognition engine. A key component in our system is a pen up/down detection model for detecting the contact of the pen-tip with the paper in the video frames. The proposed model consists of feature representation with convolutional neural networks and classification with a recurrent neural network. We also use a high speed tracker with kernelized correlation filters to track the pen-tip. For training and evaluation, we collected labeled video data of users writing English and Japanese phrases from public datasets, and we report on character accuracy scores for different frame rates in the two languages.",

    "Abstract": "Video telehealth is growing to allow more clinicians to see patients from afar. As a result, clinicians, typically trained for in-person visits, must learn to communicate both health information and non-verbal affective signals to patients through a digital medium. We introduce a system called ReflectLive that senses and provides real-time feedback about non-verbal communication behaviors to clinicians so they can improve their communication behaviors. A user evaluation with 10 clinicians showed that the real-time feedback helped clinicians maintain better eye contact with patients and was not overly distracting. Clinicians reported being more aware of their non-verbal communication behaviors and reacted positively to summaries of their conversational metrics, motivating them to want to improve. Using ReflectLive as a probe, we also discuss the benefits and concerns around automatically quantifying the “soft skills” and complexities of clinician-patient communication, the controllability of behaviors, and the design considerations for how to present real-time and summative feedback to clinicians.",

    "Abstract": "Humans are complex and their behaviors follow complex multimodal patterns, however to solve many social computing problems one often looks at complexity in large-scale yet single point data sources or methodologies. While single data/single method techniques, fueled by large scale data, enjoyed some success, it is not without fault. Often with one type of data and method, all the other aspects of human behavior are overlooked, discarded, or, worse, misrepresented. We identify this as two succinct problems. First, social computing problems that cannot be solved using a single data source and need intelligence from multiple modals and, second, social behavior that cannot be fully understood using only one form of methodology. Throughout this talk, we discuss these problems and their implications, illustrate examples, and propose new directives to properly approach in the social computing research in today’s age.",

    "Abstract": "Discovering and analyzing biclusters, i.e., two sets of related entities with close relationships, is a critical task in many real-world applications, such as exploring entity co-occurrences in intelligence analysis, and studying gene expression in bio-informatics. While the output of biclustering techniques can offer some initial low-level insights, visual approaches are required on top of that due to the algorithmic output complexity.This paper proposes a visualization technique, called BiDots, that allows analysts to interactively explore biclusters over multiple domains. BiDots overcomes several limitations of existing bicluster visualizations by encoding biclusters in a more compact and cluster-driven manner. A set of handy interactions is incorporated to support flexible analysis of biclustering results. More importantly, BiDots addresses the cases of weighted biclusters, which has been underexploited in the literature. The design of BiDots is grounded by a set of analytical tasks derived from previous work. We demonstrate its usefulness and effectiveness for exploring computed biclusters with an investigative document analysis task, in which suspicious people and activities are identified from a text corpus.",

    "Abstract": "During asynchronous collaborative analysis, handoff of partial findings is challenging because externalizations produced by analysts may not adequately communicate their investigative process. To address this challenge, we developed techniques to automatically capture and help encode tacit aspects of the investigative process based on an analyst’s interactions, and streamline explicit authoring of handoff annotations. We designed our techniques to mediate awareness of analysis coverage, support explicit communication of progress and uncertainty with annotation, and implicit communication through playback of investigation histories. To evaluate our techniques, we developed an interactive visual analysis system, KTGraph, that supports an asynchronous investigative document analysis task. We conducted a two-phase user study to characterize a set of handoff strategies and to compare investigative performance with and without our techniques. The results suggest that our techniques promote the use of more effective handoff strategies, help increase an awareness of prior investigative process and insights, as well as improve final investigative outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Whether and how does the structure of family trees differ by ancestral traits over generations? This is a fundamental question regarding the structural heterogeneity of family trees for the multi-generational transmission research. However, previous work mostly focuses on parent-child scenarios due to the lack of proper tools to handle the complexity of extending the research to multi-generational processes. Through an iterative design study with social scientists and historians, we develop TreeEvo that assists users to generate and test empirical hypotheses for multi-generational research. TreeEvo summarizes and organizes family trees by structural features in a dynamic manner based on a traditional Sankey diagram. A pixel-based technique is further proposed to compactly encode trees with complex structures in each Sankey Node. Detailed information of trees is accessible through a space-efficient visualization with semantic zooming. Moreover, TreeEvo embeds Multinomial Logit Model (MLM) to examine statistical associations between tree structure and ancestral traits. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of TreeEvo through an in-depth case-study with domain experts using a real-world dataset (containing 54,128 family trees of 126,196 individuals).",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we describe DocHandles, a novel system that allows users to link to specific document parts in their chat applications. As users type a message, they can invoke the tool by referring to a specific part of a document, e.g., “@fig1 needs revision”. By combining text parsing and document layout analysis, DocHandles can find and present all the figures “1” inside previously shared documents, allowing users to explicitly link to the relevant “document handle”. Documents become first-class citizens inside the conversation stream where users can seamlessly integrate documents in their text-centric messaging application.",

    "Abstract": "Video summarization and video captioning are considered two separate tasks in existing studies. For longer videos, automatically identifying the important parts of video content and annotating them with captions will enable a richer and more concise condensation of the video. We propose a general neural network architecture that jointly considers two supervisory signals (i.e., an image-based video summary and text-based video captions) in the training phase and generates both a video summary and corresponding captions for a given video in the test phase. Our main idea is that the summary signals can help a video captioning model learn to focus on important frames. On the other hand, caption signals can help a video summarization model to learn better semantic representations. Jointly modeling both the video summarization and the video captioning tasks offers a novel end-to-end solution that generates a captioned video summary enabling users to index and navigate through the highlights in a video. Moreover, our experiments show the joint model can achieve better performance than state-of- the-art approaches in both individual tasks.",

    "Abstract": "It is increasingly possible to use cameras and sensors to detect and analyze human appearance for the purposes of personalizing user experiences. Such systems are already deployed in some public places to personalize advertisements and recommend items. However, since these technologies are not yet widespread, we do not have a good sense of the perceived benefits and drawbacks of public display systems that use face detection as an input for personalized recommendations. We conducted a user study with a system that inferred a user’s gender and age from a facial detection and analysis algorithm and used this to present recommendations in two scenarios (finding stores to visit in a mall and finding a pair of sunglasses to buy).  This work provides an initial step towards understanding user reactions to a new and emerging form of implicit recommendation based on physical appearance.\r\n",

    "Abstract": "The availability of mobile access has shifted social media use. With that phenomenon, what users shared on social media and where they visited is naturally an excellent resource to learn their visiting behavior. Knowing visit behaviors would help market survey and customer relationship management, e.g., sending customers coupons of the businesses that they visit frequently. Most prior studies leverage meta-data e.g., check- in locations to profile visiting behavior but neglect important information from user-contributed content, e.g., images. This work addresses a novel use of image content for predicting the user visit behavior, i.e., the frequent and regular business venue categories that the content owner would visit. To collect training data, we propose a strategy to use geo-metadata associated with images for deriving the labels of an image owner’s visit behavior. Moreover, we model a user’s sequential images by using an end-to-end learning framework to reduce the optimization loss. That helps improve the prediction accuracy against the baseline as demonstrated in our experiments. The prediction is completely based on image content that is more available in social media than geo-metadata, and thus allows coverage in profiling a wider set of users.",

    "Abstract": "Video conferencing is widely used to help deliver\r\neducational presentations, such as lectures or informational\r\nwebinars, to a distributed audience. While individuals in a\r\ndyadic conversation may be able to use webcam streams to assess the engagement level of their interlocutor with some ease, as the size of the audience in a video conference setting increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to interpret how engaged the overall group may be. In this work, we use a mixed-methods approach to understand how presenters and attendees of online presentations use available cues to perceive and interpret audience behavior (such as how engaged the group is). Our results suggest that while webcams are seen as useful by presenters to increase audience visibility and encourage attention, audience members do not uniformly benefit from seeing others’ webcams; other interface cues such as chat may be more useful and informative engagement indicators for both parties. We conclude with design recommendations for future systems to improve what is sensed and presented.",

RSSI values are often converted to distances for position estimation. However due to multipathing and shadowing effects, finding a unique sensor model using both parametric and nonparametric methods is highly challenging. We learn decision regions using the Gaussian Processes classification to accept measurements that are consistent with the operating sensor model. The proposed approach can perform online, does not rely on a particular sensor model or parameters, and is robust to sensor failures. The experimental results achieved using hardware show that available positioning algorithms can benefit from incorporating the classifier into their measurement model as a meta-sensor modeling technique.",

    "Title": "Gaze-informed multimodal interaction",
    "Abstract": "Observe at a person pointing out and describing something. Where is that person looking? Chances are good that this person also looks at what she is talking about and pointing at. Gaze is naturally coordinated with our speech and hand movements. By utilizing this tendency, we can create a natural interaction with computing devices and environments. In this chapter, we will first briefly discuss some basic properties of the gaze signal we can get from eye trackers, followed by a review of a multimodal system utilizing the gaze signal as one input modality. In Multimodal Gaze Interaction, data from eye trackers is used as an active input mode where for instance gaze is used as an alternative, or complimentary, pointing modality along with other input modalities. Using gaze as an active or explicit input method is challenging for several reasons. One of them being that eyes are primarily used for perceiving our environment, so knowing when a person selects an item with gaze versus just looking around is an issue. Researchers have tried to solve this by combining gaze with various input methods, such as manual pointing, speech, touch, etc. However, gaze information can also be used in interactive systems, for other purposes than explicit pointing since a user's gaze is a good indication of the user's attention. In passive gaze interaction, the gaze is not used as the primary input method, but as a supporting input method. In these kinds of systems, gaze is mainly used for inferring and reasoning about the user's cognitive state or activities in a way that can support the interaction.  These kinds of multimodal systems often combine gaze with a multitude of input modalities.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we focus on interactive systems, exploring the design space for gaze-informed multimodal interaction spanning from gaze as active input mode to passive and if the usage scenario is stationary (at e.g. a desk) or mobile. There are a number of studies aimed at describing, detecting or modeling specific behaviors or cognitive states. We will touch on some of these works since they can guide us in how to build gaze-informed multimodal interaction.",

In this paper we explore the use of activity-, physiological-, and indoor-location sensing to promote mobility during work-breaks. While the popularity of devices and applications to promote physical activity is growing, prior research highlights important constraints when designing for the workplace. With these constraints in mind, we developed BreakSense, a mobile application that uses a Bluetooth beacon infrastructure, a smartphone and a smartwatch to encourage mobility during breaks with a game-like design. We discuss constraints imposed by design for work and the workplace, and highlight challenges associated with the use of noisy sensors and methods to overcome them. We then describe a short deployment of BreakSense within our lab that examined bound vs. unbound augmented breaks and how they affect users’ sense of completion and readiness to work.",

By projecting encoded visible patterns onto an object’s surface (e.g. paper, display, or table), and localizing the user’s fingers with light sensors, Lift offers users a richer interactive space than the device’s existing interfaces. Additionally, everyday objects can be augmented by attaching sensor units onto their surface to accept multi-touch gesture input. We also present two applications as proof of concept. Finally, results from our experiments indicate that Lift can localize ten fingers simultaneously with an average accuracy of 1.7 millimeter and an average refresh rate of 84 Hz with 31 milliseconds delay on WiFi and 23 milliseconds delay on serial communication, making gesture recognition on non-instrumented objects possible.",

    "Abstract": "Videos recorded with current mobile devices are increasingly geotagged at fine granularity and used in various location based applications and services. However, raw sensor data collected is often noisy, resulting in subsequent inaccurate geospatial analysis. In this study, we focus on the challenging correction of compass readings and present an automatic approach to reduce these metadata errors. Given the small geo-distance between consecutive video frames, image-based localization does not work due to the high ambiguity in the depth reconstruction of the scene. As an alternative, we collect geographic context from OpenStreetMap and estimate the absolute viewing direction by comparing the image scene to world projections obtained with different external camera parameters. To design a comprehensive model, we further incorporate smooth approximation and feature-based rotation estimation when formulating the error terms. Experimental results show that our proposed pyramid-based method outperforms its competitors and reduces orientation errors by an average of 58.8%. Hence, for downstream applications, improved results can be obtained with these more accurate geo-metadata. To illustrate, we present the performance gain in landmark retrieval and tag suggestion by utilizing the accuracy-enhanced geo-metadata.",

    "Title": "A General Feature-based Map Matching Framework with Trajectory Simplications.",
    "Abstract": "Accurate map matching has been a fundamental but challenging problem that has drawn great research attention in recent years. It aims to reduce the uncertainty in a trajectory by matching the GPS points to the road network on a digital map. Most existing work has focused on estimating the likelihood of a candidate path based on the GPS observations, while neglecting to model the probability of a route choice from the perspective of drivers. Here we propose a novel feature-based map matching algorithm that estimates the cost of a candidate path based on both GPS observations and human factors. To take human factors into consideration is very important especially when dealing with low sampling rate data where most of the movement details are lost. Additionally, we simultaneously analyze a subsequence of coherent GPS points by utilizing a new segment-based probabilistic map matching strategy, which is less susceptible to the noisiness of the positioning data. We have evaluated the proposed approach on a public large-scale GPS dataset, which consists of 100 trajectories distributed all over the world. The experimental results show that our method is robust to sparse data with large sampling intervals (e.g., 60 s to 300 s) and challenging track features (e.g., u-turns and loops). Compared with two state-of-the-art map matching algorithms, our method substantially reduces the route mismatch error by 6.4% to 32.3% and obtains the best map matching results in all the different combinations of sampling rates and challenging features.",

    "Title": "Semantic localization",
    "Abstract": "Improvements in sensor and wireless network enable accurate, automated, instant determination and dissemination of a user's or\r\nobjects position. The new enabler of location-based services (LBSs) apart from the current ubiquitous networking infrastructure is\r\nthe enrichment of the different systems with semantics information, such as time, location, individual capability, preference and\r\nmore. Such semantically enriched system-modeling aims at developing applications with enhanced functionality and advanced\r\nreasoning capabilities. These systems are able to deliver more personalized services to users by domain knowledge with advanced\r\nreasoning mechanisms, and provide solutions to problems that were otherwise infeasible. This approach also takes user's preference\r\nand place property into consideration that can be utilized to achieve a comprehensive range of personalized services, such as\r\nadvertising, recommendations, or polling. This paper provides an overview of indoor localization technologies, popular models for\r\nextracting semantics from location data, approaches for associating semantic information and location data, and applications that\r\nmay be enabled with location semantics. To make the presentation easy to understand, we will use a museum scenario to explain\r\npros and cons of different technologies and models. More specifically, we will first explore users' needs in a museum scenario.\r\nBased on these needs, we will then discuss advantages and disadvantages of using different localization technologies to meet these\r\nneeds. From these discussions, we can highlight gaps between real application requirements and existing technologies, and point\r\nout promising localization research directions. By identifying gaps between various models and real application requirements,\r\nwe can draw a road map for future location semantics research.",

    "Abstract": "We propose a robust pointing detection with virtual shadow representation for interacting with a public display. Using a depth camera, our shadow is generated by a model with an angled virtual sun light and detects the nearest point as a pointer. Position of the shadow becomes higher when user walks closer, which conveys the notion of correct distance to control the pointer and offers accessibility to the higher area of the display. ",

    "Abstract": "Different systems exist for the creation of hypervideos nowadays. However, the creation of the video scenes which are put together to a hypervideo is a tedious and time consuming job. Then again huge video databases like YouTube exist which already provide rich sources of video materials. Yet it is not allowed to download and re-purpose the videos from there legally, which requires a solution to link whole videos or parts of videos and play them from the platform in an embedded player. This work presents the SIVA Web Producer, a Chrome extension for the creation of hypervideos consisting of scenes from YouTube videos. After creating a project, the Chrome extension allows to import YouTube videos or parts thereof as video clips. These can than be linked to a scene graph. A preview is provided and finalized videos can be published on the SIVA Web Portal.",

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a dual screen application (handheld and TV) that allows patients to view hypervideos designed to help them correctly perform their exercises. This approach lets patients adapt their training to their daily needs and their overall training progress. We evaluated this prototypical implementation in a user test with post-operative care prostate cancer patients.

We endeavor to determine which Twitter users are potential customers for companies and would be receptive to product recommendations through the language they use in tweets after mentioning a product of interest. With Twitter's API, we collected tweets from users who tweeted about mobile devices or cameras. An expert annotator determined whether each tweet was relevant to customer purchase behavior and\r\nwhether a user, based on their tweets, eventually bought the product. For the relevance task, among four models, a feed-forward neural network yielded \r\nthe best cross-validation accuracy of over 80% per product. For customer purchase prediction of a product, we observed improved performance with the use of sequential input of tweets to recurrent models, with an LSTM model being best; we also observed the use of relevance predictions in our model to be more effective with less powerful RNNs and on more difficult tasks.\r\n",

    "Abstract": "Two related challenges with current teleoperated robotic systems are lack of peripheral vision and awareness, and difficulty or tedium of navigating through remote spaces.  We address these challenges by providing an interface with a focus plus context (F+C) view of the robot location, and where the user can navigate simply by looking where they want to go, and clicking or drawing a path on the view to indicate the desired trajectory or destination.  The F+C view provides an undistorted, perspectively correct central region surrounded by a wide field of view peripheral portion, and avoids the need for separate views. The navigation method is direct and intuitive in comparison to keyboard or joystick based navigation, which require the user to be in a control loop as the robot moves.  Both the F+C views and the direct click navigation were evaluated in a preliminary user study.",

    "Abstract": "Mobile Telepresence Robots (MTR) are an emerging technology that extend the functionality of telepresence systems by adding mobility. MTRs nowadays, however, rely on stationary imaging systems such as a single narrow-view camera for vision, which can lead to reduced operator performance due to view-related deficiencies in situational awareness. We therefore developed an improved imaging and viewing platform that allows immersive telepresence using a Head Mounted Device (HMD) with head-tracked mono and stereoscopic video. Using a remote collaboration task to ground our research, we examine the effectiveness head-tracked HMD systems in comparison to a baseline monitor-based system.  \r\nWe performed a user study where participants were divided into three groups: fixed camera monitor-based baseline condition (without HMD), HMD with head-tracked 2D camera and HMD with head-tracked stereo camera. Results showed the use of HMD reduces task error rates and improves perceived collaborative success and quality of view, compared to the baseline condition. No major difference was found, however, between stereo and 2D camera conditions for participants wearing an HMD.",

    "Title": "Pre-fetching Strategies for HTML5 Hypervideo Players",
    "Abstract": "Web videos are becoming more and more popular. Current web technologies make it simpler than ever to both stream videos and create complex constructs of interlinked videos with additional information (video, audio, images, and text); so called hypervideos. When viewers interact with hypervideos by clicking on links, new content has to be loaded. This may lead to excessive waiting times, interrupting the presentation -- especially when videos are loaded into the hypervideo player. In this work, we propose hypervideo pre-fetching strategies, which can be implemented in players to minimize waiting times. We examine the possibilities offered by the HTML5 <video> tag as well as the Media Source Extensions (MSE). Both HTML5 and MSE allow element pre-fetching (video and additional information) up to a certain granularity. Depending on the strategy and technology used, beginning scene waiting times and the overall download volume may increase. The strategies presented in this paper allow the number of delays during playback and the overall waiting time of a video to be reduced significantly from an average of 8.1 breaks to less than one break. The overall waiting times can be reduced by one third, to less than 18 seconds improving the hypervideo watching experience. ",

    "Abstract": "Mobile Audio Commander (MAC) is a mobile phone-based multimedia sensing system that facilitates the introduction of extra sensors to existing mobile robots for advanced capabilities. In this paper, we use MAC to introduce an accurate indoor positioning sensor to a robot to facilitate its indoor navigation. More specifically, we use a projector to send out position ID through light signal, use a light sensor and the audio channel on a mobile phone to decode the position ID, and send navigation commands to a target robot through audio output. With this setup, our system can simplify user's robot navigation. Users can define a robot navigation path on a phone, and our system will compare the navigation path with its accurate location sensor inputs and generate analog line-following signal, collision avoidance signal, and analog angular signal to adjust the robot's straight movements and turns. This paper describes two examples of using MAC and a positioning system to enable complicated robot navigation with proper user interface design, external circuit design and real sensor installations on existing robots.",

    "Title": "Using Business-Aware Latent Topics For Image Captioning In Social Media",
    "Abstract": "Captions are a central component in image posts that communicate the background story behind photos. Captions can enhance the engagement with audiences and are therefore critical to campaigns or advertisement. Previous studies in image captioning either rely solely on image content or summarize multiple web documents related to image's location; both neglect users' activities. We propose business-aware latent topics as a new contextual cue for image captioning that represent user activities. The idea is to learn the typical activities of people who posted images from business venues with similar categories (e.g., fast food restaurants) to provide appropriate context for similar topics (e.g., burger) in new posts. User activities are modeled via a latent topic representation. In turn, the image captioning model can generate sentences that better reflect user activities at business venues. In our experiments, the business-aware latent topics are effective for adapting to captions to images captured in various businesses than the existing baselines. Moreover, they complement other contextual cues (image, time) in a multi-modal framework.\r\n",

This paper focuses on playback plans that guide users through the recorded meeting content by automatically following available hyperlinks. Our system generates playback plans based on users' interests or prior meeting attendance and presents a dialog that lets users select the most appropriate plan. Prior experience with playback plans revealed users' confusion with automatic link following within a sequence of meetings. To address this issue, we designed three timeline visualizations of playback plans. A user study comparing the timeline designs indicated that different visualizations are preferred for different tasks, making switching among them important. The study also provided insights that will guide research of personalized hypervideo, both inside and outside a meeting context.",

    "Abstract": "It is difficult to adjust the content of traditional slide presentations to the knowledge level, interest and role of individuals. This might force presenters to include content that is irrelevant for part of the audience, which negatively affects the knowledge transfer of the presentation. In this work, we present a prototype that is able to eliminate non-pertinent information from slides by presenting annotations for individual attendees on optical head-mounted displays. We first create guidelines for creating optimal annotations by evaluating several types of annotations alongside different types of slides. Then we evaluate the knowledge acquisition of presentation attendees using the prototype versus traditional presentations. Our results show that annotations with a limited amount of information, such as text up to 5 words, can significantly increase the amount of knowledge gained from attending a group presentation. Additionally, presentations where part of the information is moved to annotations are judged more positively on attributes such as clarity and enjoyment.",

    "Title": "Screen Concepts for Multi-Version Hypervideo Authoring",
    "Abstract": "The creation of hypervideos usually requires a lot of planning and is time consuming with respect to media content creation. However, when structure and media are put together to author a hypervideo, it may only require minor changes to make the hypervideo available in other languages or for another user group (like beginners versus experts). However, to make the translation of media and all navigation elements of a hypervideo efficient and manageable, the authoring tool needs a GUI that provides a good overview of elements that can be translated and of missing translations. In this work, we propose screen concepts that help authors to provide different versions (for example language and/or experience level) of a hypervideo. We analyzed different variants of GUI elements and evaluated them in a survey. We draw guidelines from the results that can help with the creation of similar systems in the future. ",

This capability properly belongs to a public commons, available as a birthright of all humans, and can been seen as part of an evolutionary transition supporting a global collective mind. We describe examples and elements of this capability, and suggest how they can be better integrated through a tool we\r\ncall TeleViewer and a framework called WorldViews,\r\nwhich supports easy sharing of views as well as connecting of providers and consumers of views all around the world.",

The fourth edition of the WSICC workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on novel approaches for interactive multimedia content consumption. New technologies, devices, media formats, and consumption paradigms are emerging that allow for new types of interactivity. Examples include multi-panoramic video and object-based audio, increasingly available in live scenarios with content feeds from a multitude of sources. \r\nAll these recent advances have an impact on different aspects related to interactive content consumption, which the workshop categorizes into Enabling Technologies, Content, User Experience, and User Interaction. The resources from past editions of the workshop are available on the http://wsicc.net website.",

    "Title": "From Single Screen to Dual Screen - a Design Study for a User-Controlled Hypervideo-Based Physiotherapy Training",
    "Abstract": "Hypervideo based physiotherapy trainings bear an opportunity to support patients in continuing their training after being released from a rehabilitation clinic. Many exercises require the patient to sit on the floor or a gymnastic ball, lie on a gymnastics mat, or do the exercises in other postures. Using a laptop or tablet with a stand to show the exercises is more helpful than for example just having some drawings on a leaflet. However, it may lead to incorrect execution of the exercises while maintaining eye contact with the screen or require the user to get up and select the next exercise if the devices is positioned for a better view. A dual screen application, where contents are shown on a TV screen and the flow of the video can be controlled from a mobile second device, allows patients to keep their correct posture and the same time view and select contents. In this paper we propose first studies for user interface designs for such apps. Initial paper prototypes are discussed and refined in two focus groups. The results are then presented to a broader range of users in a survey. Three prototypes for the mobile app and one prototype for the TV are identified for future user tests.",

    "Abstract": "Most current mobile and wearable devices are equipped with inertial measurement units (IMU) that allow the detection of motion gestures, which can be used for interactive applications. A difficult problem to solve, however, is how to separate ambient motion from an actual motion gesture input. In this work, we explore the use of motion gesture data labeled with gesture execution phases for training supervised learning classifiers for gesture segmentation. We believe that using gesture execution phase data can significantly improve the accuracy of gesture segmentation algorithms. We define gesture execution phases as the start, middle and end of each gesture. Since labeling motion gesture data with gesture execution phase information is work intensive, we used crowd workers to perform the labeling. Using this labeled data set, we trained SVM-based classifiers to segment motion gestures from ambient movement of the device t. We describe initial results that indicate that gesture execution phase can be accurately recognized by SVM classifiers. Our main results show that training gesture segmentation classifiers with phase-labeled data substantially increases the accuracy of gesture segmentation: we achieved a gesture segmentation accuracy of 0.89 for simulated online segmentation using a sliding window approach.",

    "Title": "Beyond Actions: Exploring the Discovery of Tactics from User Logs",
    "Abstract": "Search log analysis has become a common practice to gain insights into user search behaviour, it helps gain an understanding of user needs and preferences, as well as how well a system supports such needs. Currently log analysis is typically focused on the low-level user actions, i.e. logged events such as issued queries and clicked results; and often only a selection of such events are logged and analysed. However, the types of logged events may differ widely from interface to interface, making comparison between systems difficult. Further, analysing a selection of events may lead to conclusions out of contextâ e.g. the statistics of observed query reformulations may be influenced by the existence of a relevance feedback component. Alternatively, in lab studies user activities can be analysed at a higher level, such as search tactics and strategies, abstracted away from detailed interface implementation. However, the required manual codings that map logged events to higher level interpretations prevent this type of analysis from going large scale. In this paper, we propose a new method for analysing search logs by (semi-)automatically identifying user search tactics from logged events, allowing large scale analysis that is comparable across search systems. We validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed tactic identification method using logs of two reference search systems of different natures: a product search system and a video search system. With the identified tactics, we perform a series of novel log analyses in terms of entropy rate of user search tactic sequences, demonstrating how this type of analysis allows comparisons of user search behaviours across systems of different nature and design. This analysis provides insights not achievable with traditional log analysis.",

In this work, we are trying to overcome this issue by providing an alternative input method for hypervideo navigation using speech commands. In a user test, we evaluated two different speech recognition libraries, annyang (in combination with the Web Speech API) and PocketSphinx.js (in combination with the Web Audio API), for their usability to control hypervideo players. Test users spoke 18 words, either in German or English, which were recorded and then processed by both libraries. We found out that annyang shows better recognition results. However, depending on other factors of influence, like the occurrence of background noise (reliability), the availability of an internet connection, or the used browser, PocketSphinx.js may be a better fit.

These posts may include information about the purchase activity of people, and insights useful to companies can be derived from them: e.g. profile information of a user who mentioned something about their product. As a further advanced analysis, we consider extracting users who are likely to buy a product from the set of users who mentioned that the product is attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we report our methodology for building a corpus for Twitter user purchase behavior prediction. First, we collected Twitter users who posted a want phrase + product name: e.g. \"want a Xperia\" as candidate want users, and also candidate bought users in the same way. Then, we asked an annotator to judge whether a candidate user actually bought a product. We also annotated whether tweets randomly sampled from want/bought user timelines are relevant or not to purchase. In this annotation, 58% of want user tweets and 35% of bought user tweets were annotated as relevant. Our data indicate that information embedded in timeline tweets can be used to predict purchase behavior of tweeted products.",

We then present results from a two-week in-situ diary study with 28 participants in the U.S. who logged 800 breaks, offering insights into the effect of work breaks on productivity. We finally explore the space of information visualization of work breaks and productivity in a third study.

We first review lessons from domains such as dieting and addiction research and discuss the design space of lapse management. We then explore the value of one approach to lapse management - the use of \"cheat points\" as a way to encourage sustained participation. In an online study, we first examine interpretations of progress that was reached through using cheat points. We then present findings from a deployment of lapse management in a two-week field study with 30 participants. Our results demonstrate the potential of this approach to motivate and change users' behavior. We discuss important open questions for the design of future technology-mediated behavior change programs.",

    "Abstract": "With modern technologies, it is possible to create annotated interactive non-linear videos (a form of hypervideo) for the Web. These videos have a non-linear structure of linked scenes to which additional information (other media like images, text, audio, or additional videos) can be added. A variety of user interactions - like in- and between-scene navigation or zooming into additional information - are possible in players for this type of video. Like linear video, quality of experience (QoE) with annotated hypervideo experiences is tied to the temporal consistency of the video stream at the client end - its flow. Despite its interactive complexity, users expect this type of video experience to flow as seamlessly as simple linear video. However, the added hypermedia elements bog playback engines down.\r\n\r\nDownload and cache management systems address the flow issue, but their effectiveness is tied to numerous questions respecting user requirements, computational strategy, and evaluative metrics. In this work, we a) define QoE metrics, b) examine structural and behavioral patterns of interactive annotated non-linear video, c) propose download and cache management algorithms and strategies, d) describe the implementation of an evaluative simulation framework, and e) present the algorithm test results.",

The method matches geo-tagged tweets from Twitter against venues from Foursquare to identify the specific business mentioned in a tweet.

From these venue-located tweets, we create sentiment profiles for each of the stores in a chain. We present the results as heat maps showing how sentiment differs across stores in the same chain and how some chains have more positive sentiment than other chains. We also estimate social group size from photos and create profiles of social group size for businesses. Sample heat maps of these results illustrate how the average social group size can vary across businesses.",

    "Abstract": "We describe methods for analyzing and visualizing document metadata to provide insights about collaborations over time. We investigate the use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic modeling to compute areas of interest on which people collaborate. The topics are represented in a node-link force directed graph by persistent fixed nodes laid out with multidimensional scaling (MDS), and the people by transient movable nodes. The topics are also analyzed to detect bursts to highlight \"hot\" topics during a time interval.  As the user manipulates a time interval slider, the people nodes and links are dynamically updated. We evaluate the results of LDA topic modeling for the visualization by comparing topic keywords against the submitted keywords from the InfoVis 2004 Contest, and we found that the additional terms provided by LDA-based keyword sets result in improved similarity between a topic keyword set and the documents in a corpus.  We extended the InfoVis dataset from 8 to 20 years and collected publication metadata from our lab over a period of 21 years, and created interactive visualizations for exploring these larger datasets.",

    "Abstract": "The use of videoconferencing in the workplace has been steadily growing. While multitasking during video conferencing is often necessary, it is also viewed as impolite and sometimes unacceptable. One potential contributor to negative attitudes towards such multitasking is the disrupted sense of eye contact that occurs when an individual shifts their gaze away to another screen, for example, in a dual-monitor setup, common in office settings. We present a system to improve a sense of eye contact over videoconferencing in dual-monitor setups. Our system uses computer vision and desktop activity detection to dynamically choose the camera with the best view of a userÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs face. We describe two alternative implementations of our system (RGB-only, and a combination of RGB and RGB-D cameras). We then describe results from an online experiment that shows the potential of our approach to significantly improve perceptions of a personÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs politeness and engagement in the meeting.",

    "Abstract": "Remote meetings are messy. There are an ever-increasing number of support tools available, and, as past work has shown, people will tend to select a subset of those tools to satisfy their own institutional, social, and personal needs. While video tools make it relatively easy to have conversations at a distance, they are less adapted to sharing and archiving multimedia content.  In this paper we take a deeper look at how sharing multimedia content occurs before, during, and after distributed meetings. Our findings shed light on the decisions and rationales people use to select from the vast set of tools available to them to prepare for, conduct, and reconcile the results of a remote meeting.  ",

We first report findings from interviews with 15 professional users of videoconferencing. We then report results from a controlled online experiment with 397 participants based in the United States. Our results show that the technology used for multitasking has a significant effect on others' assumptions of what secondary activity the multitasker is likely engaged in, and that this assumed activity in turn affects evaluations of politeness and appropriateness. We also describe how different layouts of the video conferencing UI may lead to better or worse ratings of engagement and in turn ratings of polite or impolite behavior. We then propose a model that captures our results and use the model to discuss implications for behavior and for the design of video communication tools. ",

However, many applications fail to realize their full potential because of limitations in current location technologies. Current frameworks work well outdoors but fare poorly indoors. In this paper we present LoCo, a new framework that can provide highly accurate room-level indoor location. LoCo does not require users to carry specialized location hardware, it uses radios that are present in most contemporary devices and, combined with a boosting classification technique, provides a significant runtime performance improvement. We provide experiments that show the combined radio technique can achieve accuracy that improves on current state-of-the-art Wi-Fi only techniques. LoCo is designed to be easily deployed within an environment and readily leveraged by application developers. We believe LoCo's high accuracy and accessibility can drive a new wave of location-driven applications and services.",

    "Title": "Business-Aware Visual Concept Discovery from Social Media for Multimodal Business Venue Recognition",
    "Abstract": "Image localization is important for marketing and recommendation of local business; however, the level of granularity is still a critical issue. Given a consumer photo and its rough GPS information, we are interested in extracting the fine-grained location information (i.e. business venues) of the image. To this end, we propose a novel framework for business venue recognition. The framework mainly contains three parts. First, business aware visual concept discovery: we mine a set of concepts that are useful for business venue recognition based on three guidelines including business-awareness, visually detectable, and discriminative power. Second, business-aware concept detection by convolutional neural networks (BA-CNN): we pro- pose a new network architecture that can extract semantic concept features from input image. Third, multimodal business venue recognition: we extend visually detected concepts to multimodal feature representations that allow a test image to be associated with business reviews and images from social media for business venue recognition. The experiments results show the visual concepts detected by BA-CNN can achieve up to 22.5% relative improvement for business venue recognition compared to the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network features. Experiments also show that by leveraging multimodal information from social media we can further boost the performance, especially in the case when the database images belonging to each business venue are scarce.\r\n",

    "Abstract": "Hypervideos yield to different challenges in the area of navigation due to their underlying graph structure. Especially when used on tablets or by older people, a lack of clarity may lead to confusion and rejection of this type of medium. To avoid confusion, the hypervideo can be extended with a well known table of contents, which needs to be created separately by the authors due to an underlying graph structure. In this work, we present an extended presentation of a table of contents for hypervideos on mobile devices. The design was tested in a real world medical training scenario with the target group of people older than 45 which is the main target group of these applications. This user group is a particular challenge since they sometimes have limited experience in the use of mobile devices and physical deficiencies with growing age. Our user interface was designed in three steps. The findings of an expert group and a survey were used to create two different prototypical versions of the display, which were then tested against each other in a user test. This test revealed that a divided view is desired. The table of contents in an easy-to-touch version should be on the left side and previews of scenes should be on the right side of the view. These findings were implemented in the existing SIVA HTML5 open source player and tested with a second group of users. This test only lead to minor changes in the GUI.",

    "Abstract": "Indoor localization is challenging in terms of both the\r\naccuracy and possible using scenarios. In this paper, we\r\nintroduce the design and implementation of a toy car\r\nlocalization and navigation system, which demonstrates that a\r\nprojected light based localization technique allows multiple\r\ndevices to know and exchange their fine-grained location\r\ninformation in an indoor environment. The projected light\r\nconsists of a sequence of gray code images which assigns each\r\npixel in the projection area a unique gray code so as to\r\ndistinguish their coordination. The light sensors installed on the\r\ntoy car and the potential âpassengerâ receive the light stream\r\nfrom the projected light stream, based on which their locations\r\nare computed. The toy car then utilizes A* algorithm to plan the\r\nroute based on its own location, orientation, the targetâs location and the map of available âroadsâ. The fast speed of localization enables the toy car to adjust its own orientation while âdrivingâ and keep itself on âroadsâ. The toy car system demonstrates that the localization technique can power other applications that require fine-grained location information of multiple objects simultaneously.",

Visual content of photos is analyzed using state-of-the-art deep learning based automatic concept recognition. An aggregate visual concept signature is thereby computed for each user. User tags manually applied to their photos are also used to construct a tf-idf based signature per user. We also obtain social groups that users join to represent their social interests. In an effort to compare the visual-based versus tag-based user profiles with social interests, we compare corresponding similarity matrices with a reference similarity matrix based on users' group memberships. A random baseline is also included that groups users by random sampling while preserving the actual group sizes. A difference metric is proposed and it is shown that the combination of visual and text features better approximates the group-based similarity matrix than either modality individually. We also validate the visual analysis against the reference inter-user similarity using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Finally we cluster users by their visual signatures and rank clusters using a cluster uniqueness criteria. ",

    "Title": "Inferring Crowd-Sourced Venues for Tweets",
    "Abstract": "Knowing the geo-located venue of a tweet can facilitate better understanding of a user's geographic context, allowing apps to more precisely present information, recommend services, and target advertisements. However, due to privacy concerns, few users choose to enable geotagging of their tweets resulting in a small percentage of tweets being geotagged; furthermore, even if the geo-coordinates are available, the closest venue to the geo-location may be incorrect.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present a method for providing a ranked list of geo-located venues for a non-geotagged tweet, which simultaneously indicates the venue name and the geo-location at a very fine-grained granularity. In our proposed method for Venue Inference for Tweets ({\\VIT}), we construct a heterogeneous social network in order to analyze the embedded social relations, and leverage available but limited geographic data to estimate the geo-located venue of tweets. A single classifier is trained to predict the probability of a tweet and a geo-located venue being linked, rather than training a separate model for each venue. We examine the performance of four types of social relation features and three types of geographic features embedded in a social network when predicting whether a tweet and a venue are linked, with a best accuracy of over 88%. We use the classifier probability estimates to rank the predicted geo-located venues of a non-geotagged tweet from over 19k possibilities, and observed an average top-5 accuracy of 29%.",

We created the concept of hypermeetings to support meetings with asynchronous attendance. Hypermeetings consist of a chain of video-recorded meetings with hyperlinks for navigating through the video content. HyperMeeting supports the synchronized viewing of prior meetings during a videoconference. Natural viewing behavior such as pausing generates hyperlinks between the previously recorded meetings and the current video recording. During playback, automatic link-following guided by playback plans present the relevant content to users. Playback plans take into account the user's meeting attendance and viewing history and match them with features such as speaker segmentation. A user study showed that participants found hyperlinks useful but did not always understand where they would take them. The study results provide a good basis for future system improvements.",

    "Title": "AN OVERVIEW OF LOCATION SEMANTICS TECHNOLOGIES AND\r\nAPPLICATIONS",
    "Abstract": "A localization system is a coordinate system for describing the world, organizing the world, and controlling the world. Without a coordinate system, we cannot specify the world in mathematical forms; we cannot regulate processes that may involve spatial collisions; we cannot even automate a robot for physical actions. This paper provides an overview of indoor localization technologies,\r\npopular models for extracting semantics from location data, approaches for associating semantic information and location data, and applications that may be enabled with location semantics. To make the presentation easy to understand, we will use a museum scenario to explain pros and cons of different technologies and models. More specifically, we will first explore usersÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ needs in a museum scenario. Based on these needs, we will then discuss advantages and disadvantages of using different\r\nlocalization technologies to meet these needs. From these discussions, we can highlight gaps\r\nbetween real application requirements and existing technologies, and point out promising\r\nlocalization research directions. Similarly, we will also discuss context information required by different applications and explore models and ontologies for connecting users, objects, and environment factors with semantics. By identifying gaps between various models and real application requirements, we can draw a roadmap for future location semantics research.",

    "Abstract": "To facilitate distributed communication in mobile settings, we developed a system for creating and sharing gaze anno-tations using head mounted displays, such as Google Glass. Gaze annotations make it possible to point out objects of interest within an image and add a verbal description to it. To create an annotation, the user simply looks at an object of interest in the image and speaks out the information connected to the object. The gaze location is recorded and inserted as a gaze marker and the voice is transcribed using speech recognition. After an annotation has been created, it can be shared with another person. We performed a user study that showed that users experienced that gaze annota-tions add precision and expressiveness compared to an annotation to the whole image.",

Our automated system first finds paper documents on a cluttered tabletop based on a text probability map, and then takes a sequence of high-resolution frames of the located document to reconstruct a high quality and fronto-parallel document page image. The quality of the resulting images enables OCR processing on the whole page. We performed a preliminary evaluation on a small set of 10 document pages and our proposed system achieved 98% accuracy with the open source Tesseract OCR engine.",

    "Abstract": "Web-based tools for remote collaboration are quickly becoming an established element of the modern workplace. During live meetings, people share web sites, edit presentation slides, and share code editors. It is common for participants to refer to previously spoken or shared content in the course of synchronous distributed collaboration. A simple approach is to index with Optical Character Recognition\r\n(OCR) the video frames, or key-frames, being shared and let user retrieve them with text queries. Here we show that a complementary approach is to look at the actions users\r\ntake inside the live document streams. Based on observations of real meetings, we focus on two important signals: text editing and mouse cursor motion. We describe the detection\r\nof text and cursor motion, their implementation in our WebRTC-based system, and how users are better able to search live documents during a meeting based on these detected and indexed actions.",

    "Abstract": "Location-enabled applications now permeate the mobile computing landscape.  As technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Apple's iBeacon protocols begin to see widespread adoption, we will no doubt see a proliferation of indoor location enabled application experiences. While not essential to each of these applications, many will require that the location of the device be true and verifiable.  In this paper, we present LocAssure, a new framework for trusted indoor location estimation.  The system leverages existing technologies like BLE and iBeacons, making the solution practical and compatible with technologies that are already in use today. In this work, we describe our system, situate it within a broad location assurance taxonomy, describe the protocols that enable trusted localization in our system, and provide an analysis of early deployment and use characteristics.  Through developer APIs, LocAssure can provide critical security support for a broad range of indoor location applications. ",

    "Abstract": "We present a general framework and working system for predicting likely affective responses of the viewers in the social media environment after an image is posted online. Our approach emphasizes a mid-level concept representation, in which intended affects of the image publisher is characterized by a large pool of visual concepts (termed PACs) detected from image content directly instead of textual metadata, evoked viewer affects are represented by concepts (termed VACs) mined from online comments, and statistical methods are used to model the correlations among these two types of concepts. We demonstrate the utilities of such approaches by developing an end-to-end Assistive Comment Robot application, which further includes components for multi-sentence comment generation, interactive interfaces, and relevance feedback functions. Through user studies, we showed machine suggested\r\ncomments were accepted by users for online posting in 90% of completed user sessions, while very favorable results were also\r\nobserved in various dimensions (plausibility, preference, and realism) when assessing the quality of the generated image comments.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper we report findings from two user studies that explore the problem of establishing common viewpoint in the context of a wearable telepresence system. In our first study, we assessed the ability of a local person (the guide) to identify the view orientation of the remote person by looking at the physical pose of the telepresence device. In the follow-up study, we explored visual feedback methods for communicating the relative viewpoints of the remote user and the guide via a head-mounted display. Our results show that actively observing the pose of the device is useful for viewpoint estimation. However, in the case of telepresence devices without physical directional affordances, a\r\nlive video feed may yield comparable results. Lastly, more abstract visualizations lead to significantly longer recognition times, but may be necessary in more complex environments.",

    "Abstract": "We present our ongoing research on automatic segmentation of motion gestures tracked by IMUs. We postulate that by recognizing gesture execution phases from motion data that we may be able to auto-delimit user gesture entries. We demonstrate that machine learning classifiers can be trained to recognize three distinct phases of gesture entry: the start, middle and end of a gesture motion. We further demonstrate that this type of classification can be done at the level of individual gestures. Furthermore, we describe how we captured a new data set for data exploration and discuss a tool we developed to allow manual annotations of gesture phase information. Initial results we obtained using the new data set annotated with our tool show a precision of 0.95 for recognition of the gesture phase and a precision of 0.93 for simultaneous recognition of the gesture phase and the gesture type.",

As the popularity of touch based devices continues to grow, understanding the affordances of edge targets on touchscreen is needed.

Our results shows that on touch devices, a target's proximity to the edge has a significant negative effect on reaction time. We examine the effect in detail and explore mitigating factors.

There is a tradeoff between detail and abstraction in visualization, especially when the amount of content increases and becomes more difficult to process. We conducted an experiment on Mechanical Turk varying the quality, detail, and visual presentation of information about an individual's past work to see how these design features affected perceptions of the worker. We found that providing detail in the display through text increased processing time and led to less positive evaluations. Visually abstract displays required less processing time but decreased confidence in evaluation. This suggests that different design parameters may engender differing psychological processes that influence reactions towards an unknown person.",

    "Abstract": "In a variety of peer production settings, from Wikipedia to open source software development to crowdsourcing, individuals may encounter, edit, or review the work of unknown others. Typically this is done without much context to the person's past behavior or performance. To understand how exposure to an unknown individual's activity history influences attitudes and behaviors, we conducted an online experiment on Mechanical Turk varying the content, quality, and presentation of information about another Turker's work history. Surprisingly, negative work history did not lead to negative outcomes, but in contrast, a positive work history led to positive initial impressions that persisted in the face of contrary information. This work provides insight into the impact of activity history design factors on psychological and behavioral outcomes that can be of use in other related settings.",

In our study, remote and co-located participants worked together in groups of three. We show, in agreement with prior literature, the strong adverse impact of being remote on participation-levels. We also show that local and remote participants perceived differently their own contributions and others.  Extending prior work, we also show that local participants exhibited significantly more overlapping speech with remote participants who used an embodied proxy, than with remote participants in basic-video conferencing (and at a rate similar to overlapping speech for co-located groups). We also describe differences in how the technologies were used to follow conversation. We discuss how these findings extend our understanding of the promise and potential limitations of embodied video-conferencing solutions.",

    "Abstract": "Our research focuses on improving the effectiveness and usability of driving mobile telepresence robots by increasing the user's sense of immersion during the navigation task. To this end we developed a robot platform that allows immersive navigation using head-tracked stereoscopic video and a HMD. We present the result of an initial user study that compares System Usability Scale (SUS) ratings of a robot teleoperation task using head-tracked stereo vision with a baseline fixed video feed and the effect of a low or high placement of the camera(s). Our results show significantly higher ratings for the fixed video condition and no effect of the camera placement. Future work will focus on examining the reasons for the lower ratings of stereo video and and also exploring further visual navigation interfaces.",

    "Title": "Visually Interpreting Names as Demographic Attributes by Exploiting Click-Through Data",
    "Abstract": "Name of an identity is strongly influenced by his/her cultural background such as gender and ethnicity, both vital attributes for user profiling, attribute-based retrieval, etc. Typically, the associations between names and attributes (e.g., people named are mostly females) are annotated manually or provided by the census data of governments. We propose to associate a name and its likely demographic attributes by exploiting click-throughs between name queries and images with automatically detected facial attributes. This is the first work attempting to translate an abstract name to demographic attributes in visual-data-driven manner, and it is adaptive to incremental data, more countries and even unseen names (the names out of click-through data) without additional manual labels. In the experiments, the automatic name-attribute associations can help gender inference with competitive accuracy by using manual labeling. It also benefits profiling social media users and keyword-based face image retrieval, especially for contributing 12% relative improvement of accuracy in adapting to unseen names.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper we report on our efforts to define a set of document extensions to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) that allow for structured timing and synchronization of elements within a Web page. Our work considers the scenario in which the temporal structure can be decoupled from the content of the Web page in a similar way that CSS does with the layout, colors and fonts. Based on the SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) temporal model we propose CSS document extensions and discuss the design and implementation of a proof of concept that realizes our contributions. As HTML5 seems to move away from technologies like Flash and XML (eXtensible Markup Language), we believe our approach provides a flexible declarative solution to specify rich media experiences that is more aligned with current Web practices.",

    "Title": "Mitigating problems in video-mediated group discussions: Towards conversation aware video-conferencing systems",
    "Abstract": "In this paper we discuss communication problems in video-mediated small group discussions. We present results from a study in which ad-hoc groups of five people, with moderator, solved a quiz question-select answer style task over a video-conferencing system. The task was performed under different delay conditions, of up to 2000ms additional one-way delay. Even with a delay up to 2000ms, we could not observe any effect on the achieved quiz scores. In contrast, the subjective satisfaction was severely negatively affected. While we would have suspected a clear conversational breakdown with such a high delay, groups adapted their communication style and thus still managed to solve the task. This is, most groups decided to switch to a more explicit turn-taking scheme.\r\nWe argue that future video-conferencing systems can provide a\r\nbetter experience if they are aware of the current conversational\r\nsituation and can provide compensation mechanisms. Thus we\r\nprovide an overview of what cues are relevant and how they are\r\naffected by the video-conferencing system and how recent\r\nadvancements in computational social science can be leveraged.  Further, we provide an analysis of the suitability of normal webcam data for such cue recognition. Based on our observations, we suggest strategies that can be implemented to alleviate the problems.",

    "Title": "The influence of interactivity patterns on the Quality of Experience in multi-party video-mediated conversations under symmetric delay conditions",
    "Abstract": "As commercial, off-the-shelf, services enable people to easily connect with friends and relatives, video-mediated communication is filtering into our daily activities. With the proliferation of broadband and powerful devices, multi-party gatherings are becoming a reality in home environments. With the technical infrastructure in place and has been accepted by a large user base, researchers and system designers are concentrating on understanding and optimizing the Quality of Experience (QoE) for participants. Theoretical foundations for QoE have identified three crucial factors for understanding the impact on the individualÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs perception: system, context, and user. While most of the current research tends to focus on the system factors (delay, bandwidth, resolution), in this paper we offer a more complete analysis that takes into consideration context and user factors. In particular, we investigate the influence of delay (constant system factor) in the QoE of multi-party conversations. Regarding the context, we extend the typical one-to-one condition to explore conversations between small groups (up to five people). In terms of user factors,\r\nwe take into account conversation analysis, turn-taking and role-theory, for better understanding the impact of different user\r\nprofiles. Our investigation allows us to report a detailed analysis on how delay influences the QoE, concluding that the actual\r\ninteractivity pattern of each participant in the conversation results on different noticeability thresholds of delays. Such results have a direct impact on how we should design and construct video-communication services for multi-party conversations, where user activity should be considered as a prime adaptation and optimization parameter.",

The method matches geo-tagged tweets from Twitter against venues from Foursquare to identify the specific business mentioned in a tweet. By linking geo-coordinates to places, the tweets associated with a business, such as a store, can then be used to profile that business. We used a sentiment estimator developed for tweets to create sentiment profiles of the stores in a chain, computing the average sentiment of tweets associated with each store. We present the results as heatmaps which show how sentiment differs across stores in the same chain and how some chains have more positive sentiment than other chains. We also created profiles of social group size for businesses and show sample heatmaps illustrating how the size of a social group can vary.",

    "Abstract": "It is now possible to develop head-mounted devices (HMDs) that allow for ego-centric sensing of mid-air gestural input. Therefore, we explore the use of HMD-based gestural input techniques in smart space environments. We developed a usage scenario to evaluate HMD-based gestural interactions and conducted a user study to elicit qualitative feedback on several HMD-based gestural input techniques. Our results show that for the proposed scenario, mid-air hand gestures are preferred to head gestures for input and rated more favorably compared to non-gestural input techniques available on existing HMDs. Informed by these study results, we developed a prototype HMD system that supports gestural interactions as proposed in our scenario. We conducted a second user study to quantitatively evaluate our prototype comparing several gestural and non-gestural input techniques. The results of this study show no clear advantage or disadvantage of gestural inputs vs.~non-gestural input techniques on HMDs. We did find that voice control as (sole) input modality performed worst  compared to the other input techniques we evaluated. Lastly, we present two further applications implemented with our system, demonstrating 3D scene viewing and ambient light control. We conclude by briefly discussing the implications of ego-centric vs.~exo-centric tracking for interaction in smart spaces.",

    "Abstract": "Secure authentication with devices or services that store sensitive and personal information is highly important. However, traditional password and pin-based authentication methods compromise between the level of security and user experience. AirAuth is a biometric authentication technique that uses in-air gesture input to authenticate users. We evaluated our technique on a predefined (simple) gesture set and our classifier achieved an average accuracy of 96.6% in an equal error rate (EER-)based study. We obtained an accuracy of 100% when exclusively using personal (complex) user gestures. In a further user study, we found that AirAuth is highly resilient to video-based shoulder surfing attacks, with a mea- sured false acceptance rate of just 2.2%. Furthermore, a longitudinal study demonstrates AirAuthâ€™s repeatability and accuracy over time. AirAuth is relatively simple, robust and requires only a low amount of computational power and is hence deployable on embedded or mobile hardware. Un- like traditional authentication methods, our systemâ€™s security is positively aligned with user-rated pleasure and excitement levels. In addition, AirAuth attained acceptability ratings in personal, office, and public spaces that are comparable to an existing stroke-based on-screen authentication technique. Based on the results presented in this paper, we believe that AirAuth shows great promise as a novel, secure, ubiquitous, and highly usable authentication method.",

The gimbal enables remote control of the viewing angle as well as providing active image stabilization while the guide is walking. We present qualitative findings from a series of 8 field tests using either Polly or only a mobile phone. We found that guides felt more physical comfort when using Polly vs. a phone and that Polly was accepted by other persons at the remote location. Remote participants appreciated the stabilized video and ability to control camera view. Connection and bandwidth issues appear to be the most challenging issues for Polly-like systems.",

Although remote users may be anyone with a\r\ndesire for `tele-visits', we focus on limited mobility users. We present a\r\nseries of prototypes and field tests that informed design iterations. Our\r\ncurrent implementations utilize a smartphone on a stabilized, remotely\r\ncontrolled gimbal that can be hand held, placed on perches or carried by\r\nwearable frame. We describe findings from trials at campus, museum and\r\nfaire tours with remote users, including quadriplegics. We found guides\r\nwere more comfortable using Polly than a phone and that Polly was\r\naccepted by other people. Remote participants appreciated stabilized\r\nvideo and having control of the camera. One challenge is negotiation\r\nof movement and view control. Our tests suggests Polly is an effective\r\nalternative to telepresence robots, phones or fixed cameras.",

Current location technologies work well outdoors but fare poorly indoors. In this paper we present LoCo, a new framework that can provide highly accurate room-level location using a supervised classification scheme. We provide experiments that show this technique is orders of magnitude more efficient than current state-of-the-art WiFi localization techniques. Low classification overhead and computational footprint make classification practical and efficient even on mobile devices. Our framework has also been designed to be easily deployed and leveraged by developers to help create a new wave of location driven applications and services.",

    "Title": "MET: Media Embedded Target\r\nfor Connecting Paper to Digital Media",
    "Abstract": "Media Embedded Target, or MET, is an iconic mark printed in a blank margin of a page that indicates a media link is associated with a nearby region of the page. It guides the user to capture the region and thus retrieve the associated link through visual search within indexed content. The target also serves to separate page regions with media links from other regions of the page. The capture application on the cell phone displays a sight having the same shape as the target near the edge of a camera-view display. The user moves the phone to align the sight with the target printed on the page. Once the system detects correct sight-target alignment, the region in the camera view is captured and sent to the recognition engine which identifies the image and causes the associated media to be displayed on the phone. Since target and sight alignment defines a capture region, this approach saves storage by only indexing visual features in the predefined capture region, rather than indexing the entire page. Target-sight alignment assures that the indexed region is fully captured. We compare the use of MET for guiding capture with two standard methods: one that uses a logo to indicate that media content is available and text to define the capture region and another that explicitly indicates the capture region using a visible boundary mark.",

This extension combines document and process metadata into an interactive representation of the retrieved documents that can be used for sense-making, navigation, and re-finding documents. In a real-world deployment spanning over two months, results show that SearchPanel appears to have been primarily used for complex information needs, in search sessions with long durations and high numbers of queries. The process metadata features in SearchPanel seem to be of particular importance when working on complex information needs.",

Furthermore, video accounts for 90% of worldwide Internet traffic. However, it is our observation that video is not widely seen as a full-fledged document;  dismissed as a media that, at worst, gilds over substance and, at best, simply augments text-based communications. In this piece, we suggest that negative attitudes toward multimedia documents that include audio and video are largely unfounded and arise mostly because we lack the necessary tools to treat video content as first-order media or to support seamlessly mixing media.",

    "Title": "Enabling 3D Tele-Immersion with Live Reconstructed Mesh Geometry with Fast Mesh Compression and Linear Rateless Coding",
    "Abstract": "3D Tele-immersion enables participants in remote locations to share, in real-time, an activity. It offers users interactive and immersive experiences, but it challenges current media streaming solutions. Work in the past has mainly focused on the efficient delivery of image-based 3D videos and on realistic rendering and reconstruction of geometry-based 3D objects. The contribution of this paper is a real-time streaming component for 3D Tele-Immersion with dynamic reconstructed geometry. This component includes both a novel fast compression method and a rateless packet protection scheme specifically designed towards the requirements imposed by real time transmission of live-reconstructed mesh geometry. Tests on a large dataset show an encoding speed-up upto 10 times at comparable compression ratio and quality, when compared to the high-end MPEG-4 SC3DMC mesh encoders. The implemented rateless code ensures complete packet loss protection of the triangle mesh object and a delivery delay within interactive bounds. Contrary to most linear fountain codes, the designed codec enables real time progressive decoding allowing partial decoding each time a packet is received. This approach is compared to transmission over TCP in packet loss rates and latencies, typical in managed WAN and MAN networks, and heavily outperforms it in terms of end-to-end delay. The streaming component has been integrated into a larger 3D Tele-Immersive environment that includes state of the art 3D reconstruction and rendering modules. This resulted in a prototype that can capture, compress transmit and render triangle mesh geometry in real-time in realistic internet conditions as shown in experiments. Compared to alternative methods, lower interactive end-to-end delay and frame rates over 3 times higher are achieved.",

    "Abstract": "Geometry based 3D Tele-Immersion is a novel emerging media application that involves on the fly reconstructed 3D mesh geometry. To enable real-time communication of such live reconstructed mesh geometry over a bandwidth limited link, fast dynamic geometry compression is needed. However, most tools and methods have been developed for compressing synthetically generated graphics content. These methods achieve good compression rates by exploiting topological and geometric properties that typically do not hold for reconstructed mesh geometry. The live reconstructed dynamic geometry is causal and often non-manifold, open, non-oriented and time-inconsistent. Based on our experience developing a prototype for 3D Teleimmersion based on live reconstructed geometry, we discuss currently available tools. We then present our approach for dynamic compression that better exploits the fact that the 3D geometry is reconstructed and achieve a state of art rate-distortion under stringent real-time constraints.",

However, such codewords formulated in Hamming space did not present obvious indexing and search performance improvement as compared to the Euclidean ones. In this paper, without explicit codeword construction, we explore to utilize binary descriptors as direct codebook indices (addresses). We propose a novel approach to build multiple index tables which parallelly check the collision of same hash values. The evaluation is performed on two public image datasets: DupImage and Holidays.

    "Title": "The Optimiser: monitoring and improving switching delays in video conferencing",
    "Abstract": "With the growing popularity of video communication systems, more people are using group video chat, rather than only one-to-one video calls. In such multi-party sessions, remote participants compete for the available screen space and bandwidth. A common solution is showing the current speaker prominently. Bandwidth limitations may not allow all streams to be sent at a high resolution at all times, especially with many participants in a call. This can be mitigated by only switching on higher resolutions when they are required. This switching encounters delays due to latency and the properties of encoded video streams. In this paper, we analyse and improve the switching delay of our video conferencing system. Our server-centric system offers a next-generation video chat solution, providing end-to-end video encoding. To evaluate our system we use a testbed that allows us to emulate different network conditions. We measure the video switching delay between three clients, each connected via different network profiles. Our results show that missing Intra-Frames in the transmission has a strong influence on the switching delay. Based on this, we provide an optimization mechanism that improves those delays by resending Intra-Frames.",

    "Title": "Multimedia Authoring and Annotation",
    "Abstract": "With the massive amount of captured multimedia, authoring is more relevant than ever. Multimedia content is available in many settings including the web, mobile devices, desktop applications, as well as games and interactive TV. The authoring and production of multimedia documents demands attention to many issues related to the structure and to the synchronization of the media components, to the specification of the document and of the interaction, to the roles of authors and end users, as well as issues concerning reuse and digital rights management. Several complementary approaches to support the authoring of multimedia documents have been reported in the literature, and in many cases they have been studied via authoring tools and applications. One aim of this special issue is to assess current approaches, tools and applications, discussing how they tackle the main issues relative to the process of authoring, as well as their limitations.",

    "Title": "HiFi: Hide and Find Digital Contents Associated with Physical Objects via Coded Light",
    "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose HiFi system which enables users to interact with surrounding physical objects. It uses coded light to encode position in an environment. By attaching a tiny light sensor on a userâ€™s mobile device, the user can attach digital info to arbitrary static physical objects or retrieve/modify them anchored to these objects. With this system, a family member may attach a digital maintenance schedule to a fish tank or indoor plants, etc. In a store, a store manager may use such system to attach price tag, discount info and multimedia contents to any products and customers can get the attached info by moving their phone close to the focused product. Similarly, a museum can use this system to provide extra info of displayed items to visitors. Different from computer vision based systems, HiFi does not have requests on texture, bright illumination, etc. Different from regular barcode approaches, HiFi does not require extra physical attachments that may change an objectâ€™s native appearance. HiFi has much higher spatial resolution for distinguishing close objects or attached parts of the same object. As HiFi system can track a mobile device at 80 positions per second, it also has much faster response than any above listed system.",

    "Abstract": "Real-time tele-immersion requires low latency, synchronized multi-camera capture. Prior high definition (HD) capture systems were bulky. We in vestigate the suitability of using flocks of smartphone cameras for tele-immersion. Smartphones can potentially integrate HD capture and streaming into a single portable package. However, they are designed for archiving the captured video into a movie. Hence, we create a sequence of H.264 movies and stream them. We lower the capture delay by reducing the number of frames in each movie segment. Increasing the number of movie segments adds compression overhead. Smartphone video encoders do not sacrifice video quality to lower the compression latency or the stream size. On an iPhone 4S, our application that uses published APIs streams 1920x1080 videos at 16.5 fps with a delay of 712 msec between a real-life event and displaying an uncompressed bitmap of this event on a local laptop. For comparison, the bulky Cisco Tandberg required 300 msec delay. Stereoscopic video from two unsynchronized smartphones showed minimal visual artifacts in an indoor teleconference setting.",

    "Abstract": "The expressiveness of touch input can be increased by detecting additional finger pose information at the point of touch such as finger rotation and tilt. PointPose is a prototype that performs finger pose estimation at the location of touch using a short-range depth sensor viewing the touch screen of a mobile device. We present an algorithm that extracts finger rotation and tilt from a point cloud generated by a depth sensor oriented towards the device's touchscreen. The results of two user studies we conducted show that finger pose information can be extracted reliably using our proposed method. We show this for controlling rotation and tilt axes separately and also for combined input tasks using both axes. With the exception of the depth sensor, which is mounted directly on the mobile device, our approach does not require complex external tracking hardware, and, furthermore, external computation is unnecessary as the finger pose extraction algorithm can run directly on the mobile device. This makes PointPose ideal for prototyping and developing novel mobile user interfaces that use finger pose estimation.",

    "Title": "Socially-Aware Multimedia Authoring: Past, Present, and Future",
    "Abstract": "Creating compelling multimedia productions is a nontrivial task. This is as true for creating professional content as it is for nonprofessional editors. During the past 20 years, authoring networked content has been a part of the research agenda of the multimedia community. Unfortunately, authoring has been seen as an initial enterprise that occurs before â€˜realâ€™ content processing takes place. This limits the options open to authors and to viewers of rich multimedia content for creating and receiving focused, highly personal media presentations. This article reflects on the history of multimedia authoring. We focus on the particular task of supporting socially-aware multimedia, in which the relationships within particular social groups among authors and viewers can be exploited to create highly personal media experiences. We provide an overview of the requirements and characteristics of socially-aware multimedia authoring within the context of exploiting community content. We continue with a short historical perspective on authoring support for these types of situations. We then present an overview of a current system for supporting socially-aware multimedia authoring within the community content. We conclude with a discussion of the issues that we feel can provide a fruitful basis for future multimedia authoring support. We argue that providing support for socially-aware multimedia authoring can have a profound impact on the nature and architecture of the entire multimedia information processing pipeline.",

    "Abstract": "Unlike text, copying and pasting parts of video documents is challenging. Yet, the huge amount of video documents now available in the form of how-to tutorials begs for simpler techniques that allow users to easily copy and paste fragments of video materials into new documents. We describe new direct video manipulation techniques that allow users to quickly copy and paste content from video documents such as how-to tutorials into a new document. While the video plays, users interact with the video canvas to select text regions, scrollable regions, slide sequences built up across many frames, or semantically meaningful regions such as dialog boxes. Instead of relying on the timeline to accurately select sub-parts of the video document, users navigate using familiar selection techniques such as mouse-wheel to scroll back and forward over a video region where content scrolls, double-clicks over rectangular regions to select them, or clicks and drags over textual regions of the video canvas to select them. We describe the video processing techniques that run in real-time in modern web browsers using HTML5 and JavaScript; and show how they help users quickly copy and paste video fragments into new documents, allowing them to efficiently reuse video documents for authoring or note-taking.",

We built an application for the iPhone 4S that captures a sequence of hi-res (8 MP) images of a page spread as the user sweeps the device across the book. To do the 3D dewarping, we implemented two algorithms: optical flow (OF) and structure from motion (SfM). Making further use of the image sequence, we examined the potential of multi-frame OCR. Preliminary evaluation on a small set of data shows that OF and SfM had comparable OCR performance for both single-frame and multi-frame techniques, and that multi-frame was substantially better than single-frame. The computation time was much less for OF than for SfM.",

We introduced a query preview interface that visualizes the distribution of newly-retrieved and re-retrieved documents prior to showing the detailed query results. When evaluating the preview control with a control condition, we found effects on both peopleâ€™s information seeking behavior and improved retrieval performance. People spent more time formulating a query and were more likely to explore search results more deeply, retrieved a more diverse set of documents, and found more different relevant documents when using the preview.  With more time spent on query formulation, higher quality queries were produced and as consequence the retrieval results improved; both average residual precision and recall was higher with the query preview present.",

    "Title": "Private Aggregation for Presence Streams",
    "Abstract": "Collaboration technologies must support information sharing between collaborators, but must also take care not to share too much information or share information too widely. Systems that share information without requiring an explicit action by a user to initiate the sharing must be particularly cautious in this respect. Presence systems are an emerging class of applications that support collaboration. Through the use of pervasive sensors, these systems estimate user location, activities, and available communication channels. Because such presence data are sensitive, to achieve wide-spread adoption, sharing models must reflect the privacy and sharing preferences of their users. This paper looks at the role that privacy-preserving aggregation can play in addressing certain user sharing and privacy concerns with respect to presence data.\r\n\r\n<br><BR>\r\n\r\nWe define conditions to achieve CollaPSE (Collaboration Presence Sharing Encryption) security, in which (i) an individual has full access to her own data, (ii) a third party performs computation on the data without learning anything about the data values, and (iii) people with special privileges called â€œanalystsâ€ can learn statistical information about groups of individuals, but nothing about the individual values contributing to the statistic other than what can be deduced from the statistic. More specifically, analysts can decrypt aggregates without being able to decrypt the individual values contributing to the aggregate. Based in part on studies we carried out that illustrate the need for the conditions encapsulated by CollaPSE security, we designed and implemented a family of CollaPSE protocols. We analyze their security, discuss efficiency tradeoffs, describe extensions, and review more recent privacy-preserving aggregation work.",

    "Abstract": "Motivated by the addition of gyroscopes to a large number of new smart phones, we study the effects of combining accelerometer and gyroscope data on the recognition rate of motion gesture recognizers with dimensionality constraints. Using a large data set of motion gestures we analyze results for the following algorithms: Protractor3D, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Regularized Logistic Regression (LR). We chose to study these algorithms because they are relatively easy to implement, thus well suited for rapid prototyping or early deployment during prototyping stages. For use in our analysis, we contribute a method to extend Protractor3D to work with the 6D data obtained by combining accelerometer and gyroscope data. Our results show that combining accelerometer and gyroscope data is beneficial also for algorithms with dimensionality constraints and improves the gesture recognition rate on our data set by up to 4%.",

    "Abstract": "People frequently capture photos with their smartphones, and some are starting to capture images of documents. However, the quality of captured document images is often lower than expected, even when applications that perform post-processing to improve the image are used. To improve the quality of captured images before post-processing, we developed a Smart Document Capture (SmartDCap) application that provides real-time feedback to users about the likely quality of a captured image.  The quality measures capture the sharpness and framing of a page or regions on a page, such as a set of one or more columns, a part of a column, a figure, or a table. Using our approach, while users adjust the camera position, the application automatically determines when to take a picture of a document to produce a good quality result. We performed a subjective evaluation comparing SmartDCap and the Android Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) camera application; we also used raters to evaluate the quality of the captured images. Our results indicate that users find SmartDCap to be as easy to use as the standard ICS camera application. Additionally, images captured using SmartDCap are sharper and better framed on average than images using the ICS camera application.",

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is used similarly to extract spoken text from the recorded audio. These two text sources have distinct characteristics and relative strengths for video retrieval.\r\nWe perform controlled experiments with manually created ground truth for both the slide and spoken text from more than 60 hours of lecture video. We compare the automatically extracted slide and spoken text in terms of accuracy relative to ground truth, overlap with one another, and utility for video retrieval. Experiments reveal that automatically recovered slide text and spoken text contain different content with varying error profiles. Additional experiments demonstrate higher precision video retrieval using automatically extracted slide text.",

A rich sensor network dynamically updates the models, determining the position of people, status of rooms, or updating textures to reflect displays or bulletin boards.

People in one part of a building can get a sense of activities in the rest of the building, know who is present in their office, and look in to presentations in other rooms. A  spatial graph is derived from the 3D models which is used both to navigational paths and for fusion of acoustic, WiFi, motion and image sensors\r\nused for positioning. We describe usage scenarios for the system as deployed in two research labs, and a conference venue.\r\n",

    "Abstract": "Audio-based receiver localization in indoor environ-ments has multiple\r\napplications including indoor navigation, loca-tion tagging, and\r\ntracking. Public places like shopping malls and consumer stores often\r\nhave loudspeakers installed to play music for public\r\nentertainment. Similarly, office spaces may have sound conditioning\r\nspeakers installed to soften other environmental noises. We discuss an\r\napproach to leverage this infrastructure to perform audio-based\r\nlocalization of devices requesting local-ization in such environments,\r\nby playing barely audible controlled sounds from multiple speakers at\r\nknown positions. Our approach can be used to localize devices such as\r\nsmart-phones, tablets and laptops to sub-meter accuracy. The user does\r\nnot need to carry any specialized hardware. Unlike acoustic approaches\r\nwhich use high-energy ultrasound waves, the use of barely audible (low\r\nenergy) signals in our approach poses very different challenges. We\r\ndiscuss these challenges, how we addressed those, and experimental\r\nresults on two prototypical implementations: a request-play-record\r\nlocalizer, and a continuous tracker. We evaluated our approach in a\r\nreal world meeting room and report promising initial results with\r\nlocalization accuracy within half a meter 94% of the time. The system\r\nhas been deployed in multiple zones of our office building and is now\r\npart of a location service in constant operation in our lab.",

    "Abstract": "Reading is part of how we understand the world, how we share knowledge, how we play, and even how we think. Although reading text is the dominant form of reading, most of the text we readâ€” letters, numbers, words, and sentencesâ€”is surrounded by illustrations, photographs, and other kinds of symbols that we include as we read.  As dynamic displays migrate into the real world at many scales, whether personal devices, handhelds, or large screens in both interior and exterior spaces, opportunities for reading migrate as well.  As has happened continually throughout the history of reading, new technologies, physical forms and social patterns create new genres, which themselves may then combine or collide to morph into something new.\r\n\r\nAt PARC, the RED (Research in Experimental Design) group examined emerging technologies for impact on media and the human relationship to information, especially reading.  We explored new ways of experiencing text: new genres, new styles of interaction, and unusual media. Among the questions we considered: how might â€œthe bookâ€ change? More particularly, how does the experience of reading change with the introduction of new technologiesâ€¦and how does it remain the same?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll discuss the ideas behind the design and research process that led to creating eleven different experiences of new forms of reading. Weâ€™ll also consider how our technological context for reading has changed in recent years, and what influence the lessons from XFR may have on our ever-developing online reading experiences.\r\n",

    "Abstract": "DisplayCast is a many to many screen sharing system that is targeted towards Intranet scenarios. The capture software runs on all computers whose screens need to be shared. It uses an application agnostic screen capture mechanism that creates a sequence of pixmap images of the screen updates. It transforms these pixmaps to vastly improve the lossless Zlib compression performance. These algorithms were developed after an extensive analysis of typical screen contents. DisplayCast shares the processor and network resources required for screen capture, compression and transmission with host applications whose output needs to be shared. It balances the need for high performance screen capture with reducing its resource interference with user applications. DisplayCast uses Zeroconf for naming and asynchronous location. It provides support for Cisco WiFi and Bluetooth based localization. It also includes a HTTP/REST based controller for remote session initiation and control. DisplayCast supports screen capture and playback in computers running Windows 7 and Mac OS X operating systems. Remote screens can be archived into a H.264 encoded movie on a Mac. They can also be played back in real time on Apple iPhones and iPads. The software is released under a New BSD license.",

    "Title": "Understanding Screen Contents for Building a High Performance, Real Time Screen Sharing System",
    "Abstract": "Faithful sharing of screen contents is an important collaboration feature. Prior systems were designed to operate over constrained networks. They performed poorly even without such bottlenecks. To build a high performance screen sharing system, we empirically analyzed screen contents for a variety of scenarios. We showed that screen updates were sporadic with long periods of inactivity. When active, screens were updated at far higher rates than was supported by earlier systems. The mismatch was pronounced for interactive scenarios. Even during active screen updates, the number of updated pixels were frequently small. We showed that crucial information can be lost if individual updates were merged. When the available system resources could not support high capture rates, we showed ways in which updates can be effectively collapsed. We showed that Zlib lossless compression performed poorly for screen updates. By analyzing the screen pixels, we developed a practical transformation that significantly improved compression rates. Our system captured 240 updates per second while only using 4.6 Mbps for interactive scenarios. Still, while playing movies in fullscreen mode, our approach could not achieve higher capture rates than prior systems; the CPU remains the bottleneck. A system that incorporates our findings is deployed within the lab.",

    "Abstract": "Paper and Computers have complementary advantages and are used side by side in many scenarios. Interactive paper systems aim to combine the two media. However, most such systems only allow fingers and pens to interact with content on paper. This finger-pen-only input suffers from low precision, lag, instability and occlusion. Moreover, it incurs frequent device switch (e.g. pen vs. mouse) in usersâ€™ hand during cross-media interactions, yielding inefficiency and interruptions of a document workspace continuum.   \r\nTo address these limitations, we propose MixPad, a novel interactive paper system which incorporates mice and keyboards to enhance the conventional pen-finger-based paper interaction. Similar to many other systems, MixPad adopts a mobile camera-projector unit to recognize paper documents, detect pen and finger gestures and provide visual feedback. Unlike these systems, MixPad supports users to use mice and keyboards to select fine-grained content and create annotation on paper, and to facilitate bimanual operations for more efficient and smoother cross-media interaction. This novel interaction style combines the advantages of mice, keyboards, pens and fingers, enabling richer digital functions on paper.    \r\n",

    "Abstract": "In this demonstration we will show a mobile remote control and monitoring application for a recipe development laboratory at a local chocolate production company. In collaboration with TCHO, a chocolate maker in San Francisco, we built a mobile Web app designed to allow chocolate makers to control their laboratoryâ€™s machines.  Sensor data is imported into the app from each machine in the lab. The mobile Web app is used for control, monitoring, and collaboration. We have tested and deployed this system at the real-world factory and it is now in daily use. This project is designed as part of a research exploration into enhanced collaboration in industrial settings between physically remote people and places, e.g. factories in China with clients in the US.",

As face-to-face communication has been supplemented with ever-richer mediaâ€“â€“textual books, illustrations and photographs, audio, film and video, and moreâ€“â€“the possibilities for knowledge transfer have only expanded. One of the latest trends to emerge amidst the growth of Internet sharing and pervasive mobile devices is the mass creation of online instructional videos.

    "Abstract": "Faunus addresses the challenge of specifying and managing complex collaboration sessions. Many entities from various administrative domains orchestrate such sessions. Faunus decouples the entities that specify the session from entities that activate and manage them. It restricts the operations to specific agents using capabilities. It unifies the specification and management operations through its naming system. Each Faunus name is persistent and globally unique. A collection of attributes are attached to each name. Together, they represent a collection of services that form a collaboration session. Anyone can create a name; the creator has full read and write privileges that can be delegated to others. With the proper capability, anyone can modify session attributes between an active and inactive state. Though the system is designed for Internet scale deployments, the security model for providing and revoking capabilities currently assumes an Intranet style deployment. We have incorporated Faunus into a DisplayCast system that originally used Zeroconf. We are incorporating Faunus into another project that will fully exercise the power of Faunus.",

We examine design considerations for automatic tagging of office document pages with genre membership. These include selecting\r\nfeatures that characterize genre-related information in office documents, examining the utility of text-based features and image-based features, and proposing a simple ensemble method to improve genre identification performance. In the open-set identification of four office document genres, our experiments show that when combined with image-based\r\nfeatures, text-based features do not significantly influence performance. These results provide support for a\r\ntopic-independent approach to genre identification of office documents. Experiments also show that our simple ensemble method significantly improves performance relative to using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier alone.\r\nWe demonstrate the utility of our approach by integrating our automatic genre tags in a faceted search and browsing application for office document collections.",

    "Abstract": "We will demonstrate successive and final stages in the iterative design of a complex mixed reality system in a real-world factory setting.  In collaboration with TCHO, a chocolate maker in San Francisco, we built a virtual â€œmirrorâ€ world of a real-world chocolate factory and its processes.  Sensor data is imported into the multi-user 3D environment from hundreds of sensors and a number of cameras on the factory floor. The resulting virtual factory is used for simulation, visualization, and collaboration, using a set of interlinked, real-time layers of information. It can be a stand-alone or a web-based application, and also works on iOS and Android cell phones and tablet computers. A unique aspect of our system is that it is designed to enable the incorporation of lightweight social media-style interactions with co-workers along with factory data. Through this mixture of mobile, social, mixed and virtual technologies, we hope to create systems for enhanced collaboration in industrial settings between physically remote people and places, such as factories in China with managers in the US.",

We propose to use them as â€˜light beamsâ€™: Everyday objects sojourning in a beam are turned into dedicated projection surfaces and tangible interaction devices. While this has been explored for large projectors, the affordances of pico projectors are fundamentally different: they have a very small and strictly limited projection ray and can be carried around in a nomadic way during the day. Thus it is unclear how this could be actually leveraged for tangible interaction with physical, real world objects. We have investigated this in an exploratory field study and contribute the results. Based upon these, we present exemplary interaction techniques and early user feedback.",

    "Abstract": "This paper describes a system for capturing images\r\nof a book with a 3D stereo camera which performs\r\ndewarping to produce output images that are flattened. A\r\nFujifilm consumer grade 3D camera (FinePix W3) provides\r\na highly mobile and low cost 3D capture device. Applying\r\nstandard computer vision algorithms, the camera is calibrated\r\nand the captured images are stereo rectified. Due to technical\r\nlimitations, the resulting point cloud has defects such as\r\nsplotches and noise, which make it hard to recover the precise\r\n3D locations of the points on the book pages. We address this\r\nproblem by computing curve profiles of the depth map and\r\nusing them to build a cylinder model of the pages. We then\r\ngenerate a mesh M1 on the source image and project this into\r\na mesh M2 on the cylinder model in virtual space. Finally, the\r\nmesh M2 is flattened and the pixels in M1 are interpolated and\r\nrendered via M2 onto the output image. We have implemented\r\na prototype of the system and report on some preliminary\r\nevaluation results.",

    "Title": "Evaluating and Understanding the Usability of a Pen-based Command System for Interactive Paper",
    "Abstract": "To combine the affordances of paper and computers, prior research has proposed numerous interactive paper systems that link specific paper document content to digital operations such as multimedia playback and proofreading. Yet, it remains unclear to what degree these systems bridge the inherent gap between paper and computers when compared to existing paper-only and computer-only interfaces. In particular, given the special properties of paper, such as limited dynamic feedback, how well does an average new user learn to master the interactive paper system? What factors affect the user performance? And how does the paper interface work in a typical use scenario?\r\n\r\nTo answer these questions, we conducted two empirical experiments on a generic pen gesture based command system, called PapierCraft [Liao, et al., 2008], for paper-based interfaces. With it, people can select sections of printed document and issue commands such as copy and paste, linking and in-text search. The first experiment focused on the user performance of drawing pen gestures on paper. It proves that users can learn the command system in about 30 minutes and achieve a performance comparable to a Table PC-based interface supporting the same gestures. The second experiment examined the application of the command system in Active Reading tasks. The results show promise for seamless integration of paper and computers in Active Reading for their combined affordances. In addition, our study identifies some key design issues, such as the pen form factor and feedback of gestures. This paper contributes to better understanding on pros and cons of paper and computers, and sheds light on the design of future interfaces for document interaction. \r\n",

The searchable index is built from the text of presentation slides appearing in the video along with other associated metadata such as the title and abstract when available.\r\n\r\nThe automatic identification of distinct slides within the video stream presents several challenges. For example, picture-in-picture compositing of a speaker and a presentation slide, switching cameras, and slide builds confuse basic algorithms for extracting keyframe slide images. Enhanced algorithms are described that improve slide identification.\r\n\r\nA public system was deployed to test the algorithms and the utility of the search engine at www.talkminer.com.

To address these problems, we developed myUnity, a software and sensor platform that enables rich workplace awareness and coordination. myUnity is an integrated platform that collects information from a set of independent sensors and external data aggregators to report user location, availability, tasks, and communication channels. myUnityÃ¢â¬â¢s sensing architecture is component-based,\r\nallowing channels of awareness information to be added, updated, or removed at any time. Multiple channels of input are combined and composited into a single, high-level presence state. Early studies of a myUnity deployment have demonstrated that the platform allows quick access to core awareness information and show that it has become a useful tool for supporting communication and collaboration in the modern workplace.",

    "Abstract": "Presence systems are valuable in supporting workplace communication and collaboration. These systems are only effective if widely adopted and used. User perceptions of the utility of the information being shared and their comfort sharing such information strongly impact adoption and use. This paper describes the results of a survey of user preferences regarding comfort with and utility of workplace presence systems; the effects of sampling frequency, fidelity, and aggregation; and design implications of these results. We present new results that extend some past findings while challenging others. We contribute new design insights that inform the design of presence technologies to increase both utility and adoption.\r\n",

    "Title": "Minimum Correspondence Sets for \r\nImproving Large-Scale Augmented Paper\r\n",
    "Abstract": "Augmented Paper (AP) is an important area of Augmented Reality (AR). Many AP systems rely on visual features for paper doc-ument identification. Although promising, these systems can hardly support large sets of documents (i.e. one million documents) because of the high memory and time cost in handling high-dimensional features. On the other hand, general large-scale image identification techniques are not well customized to AP, costing unnecessarily more resource to achieve the identification accuracy required by AP.\r\nTo address this mismatching between AP and image identification techniques, we propose a novel large-scale image identification technique well geared to AP. At its core is a geometric verification scheme based on Minimum visual-word Correspondence Set (MICSs). MICS is a set of visual word (i.e. quantized visual fea-ture) correspondences, each of which contains a minimum number of correspondences that are sufficient for deriving a transformation hypothesis between a captured document image and an indexed image. Our method selects appropriate MICSs to vote in a Hough space of transformation parameters, and uses a robust dense region detection algorithm to locate the possible transformation models in the space.  The models are then utilized to verify all the visual word correspondence to precisely identify the matching indexed image. \r\nBy taking advantage of unique geometric constraints in AP, our method can significantly reduce the time and memory cost while achieving high accuracy. As showed in evaluation with two AP systems called FACT and EMM, over a dataset with 1M+ images, our method achieves 100% identification accuracy and 0.67% registration error for FACT; For EMM, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art image identification approach by achieving 4% improvements in detection rate and almost perfect precision, while saving 40% and 70% memory and time cost.\r\n",

    "Abstract": "PaperUI is a human-information interface concept that advocates using paper as displays and using mobile devices, such as camera phones or camera pens, as traditional computer-mice. When emphasizing technical efforts, some researchers like to refer the PaperUI related underlying work as interactive paper system. We prefer the term PaperUI for emphasizing the final goal, narrowing the discussion focus, and avoiding terminology confusion between interactive paper system and interactive paper computer [40]. PaperUI combines the merits of paper and the mobile devices, in that users can comfortably read and flexibly arrange document content on paper, and access digital functions related to the document via the mobile computing devices. This concept aims at novel interface technology to seamlessly bridge the gap between paper and computers for better user experience in handling documents. Compared with traditional laptops and tablet PCs, devices involved in the PaperUI concept are more light-weight, compact, energy efficient, and widely adopted. Therefore, we believe this interface vision can make computation more convenient to access for general public.",

    "Abstract": "Modern office work practices increasingly breach traditional boundaries of time and place, making it difficult to interact with colleagues. To address these problems, we developed myUnity, a software and sensor platform that enables rich workplace awareness and coordination. myUnity is an integrated platform that collects information from a set of independent sensors and external data aggregators to report user location, availability, tasks, and communication channels. myUnity's sensing architecture is component-based, allowing channels of awareness information to be added, updated, or removed at any time. Our current system includes a variety of sensor and data input, including camera-based activity classification, wireless location trilateration, and network activity monitoring. These and other input channels are combined and composited into a single, high-level presence state. Early studies of a myUnity deployment have demonstrated that use of the platform allows quick access to core awareness information and show it has become a useful tool supporting communication and collaboration in the modern workplace.",

By using the document content for retrieval, EMMs are less visually intrusive than barcodes and other glyphs while still providing an indication for the presence of links. An initial implementation demonstrated good overall performance but exposed difficulties in guaranteeing the creation of unambiguous EMMs. We developed an EMM authoring tool that supports the interactive authoring of EMMs via visualizations that show the user which areas on a page may cause recognition errors and automatic feedback that moves the authored EMM away from those areas. The authoring tool and the techniques it relies on have been applied to corpora with different visual characteristics to explore the generality of our approach.",

A subset of the candidate clusters is selected by an efficient dynamic programming\r\n procedure to optimize a cost function.  We propose several cost functions to design clusterings that are coherent in space, time, or both.  One set of cost functions minimizes inter-photo distances directly.  A second set maximizes an information measure to select clusterings for consistency in both time and space across scale.",

Similar to many interactive paper systems, MixPad adopts a mobile camera-projector unit to recognize paper documents, detect pen and finger gestures and provide visual feedback. Unlike these systems, MixPad allows using mice and keyboards to help users interact with fine-grained document content on paper (e.g. individual words and user-defined arbitrary regions), and to facilitate cross-media operations. For instance, to copy a document segment from paper to a laptop, one first points a finger of her non-dominant hand to the segment roughly, and then uses a mouse in her dominant hand to refine the selection and drag it to the laptop; she can also type text as a detailed comment on a paper document. This novel interaction paradigm combines the advantages of mice, keyboards, pens and fingers, and therefore enables rich digital functions on paper.",

We evaluate these extensions using a Twitter corpus and two newspaper article collections.

    "Abstract": "As sensors become ever more prevalent, more and\r\nmore information will be collected about each of us. A longterm\r\nresearch question is how best to support beneficial uses\r\nwhile preserving individual privacy. Presence systems are an\r\nemerging class of applications that support collaboration. These\r\nsystems leverage pervasive sensors to estimate end-user location,\r\nactivities, and available communication channels. Because such\r\npresence data are sensitive, to achieve wide-spread adoption,\r\nsharing models must reflect the privacy and sharing preferences\r\nof the users. To reflect users' collaborative relationships and\r\nsharing desires, we introduce CollaPSE security in which an\r\nindividual has full access to her own data, a third party processes\r\nthe data without learning anything about the data values, and\r\nusers higher up in the hierarchy learn only statistical information\r\nabout the employees under them. We describe simple schemes\r\nthat efficiently realize CollaPSE security for time series data.\r\nWe implemented these protocols using readily available cryptographic\r\nfunctions, and integrated the protocols with FXPAL's\r\nMyUnity presence system.",

Due to technological restrictions, none of them has yet investigated, what we feel is the most promising research direction: the (bi-manual) interaction with mobile projections on non-planar surfaces. To elicit the challenges of this field of research, we contribute (1) a technology-centered design space for mobile projector-based interfaces and discus related work in light thereof, (2) a discussion on lessons learnt from two of our research projects, which aim at improving both usability and user experience and (3) an outline of open research challenges within this field.\r\n\r\n",

    "Abstract": "For document visualization, folding techniques provide a focus-plus-context approach with fairly high legibility on flat sections.  To enable richer interaction, we explore the design space of multi-touch document folding.  We discuss several design considerations for simple modeless gesturing and compatibility with standard Drag and Pinch gestures, and categorize gesture models along the characteristics of Symmetric/Asymmetric and Sequential/Parallel, which yields three gesture models.  We built a prototype document workspace application that integrates folding and standard gestures, and a prototype for experimenting with the gesture models.  A user study was conducted to compare the three models and to analyze the factors of fold direction, target symmetry, and target tolerance in user performance of folding a document to a specific shape.  Our results indicate that all three factors were significant for task times, and parallelism was greater for symmetric targets.",

    "Abstract": "Embedded Media Marker (EMM) identification system allows users to retrieve relevant dynamic media associated with a static paper document via camera phones. The user supplies a query image by capturing an EMM-signified patch of a paper document through a camera phone; the system recognizes the query and in turn retrieves and plays the corresponding media on the phone. Accurate image matching is crucial for positive user experience in this application.  To address the challenges posed by large datasets and variations in camera-phone-captured query images, we introduce a novel image matching scheme based on geometrically consistent correspondences. Two matching constraints - \"injection\" and \"approximate global geometric consistency\" (AGGC), which are unique in EMM identification, are presented. A hierarchical scheme, combined with two constraining functions, is designed to detect the \"injective-AGGC\" correspondences between images. A spatial neighborhood search approach is further proposed to address challenging cases with large translational shift. Experimental results on a 100k+ dataset show that our solution achieves high accuracy with low memory and time complexity and outperforms the standard bag-of-words approach.",

    "Abstract": "User-generated video from mobile phones, digital cameras, and other devices is increasing, yet people rarely want to watch all the captured video. More commonly, users want a single still image for printing or a short clip from the video for creating a panorama or for sharing. Our interface aims to help users search through video for these images or clips in a more efficient fashion than fast-forwarding or \"scrubbing\" through a video by dragging through locations on a slider. It is based on a hierarchical structure of keyframes in the video, and combines a novel user interface design for browsing a video segment tree with new algorithms for keyframe selection, segment identification, and clustering. These algorithms take into account the need for quality keyframes and balance the desire for short navigation paths and similarity-based clusters. Our user interface presents keyframe hierarchies and displays visual cues for keeping the user oriented while browsing the video. The system adapts to the task by using a non-temporal clustering algorithm when a the user wants a single image. When the user wants a video clip, the system selects one of two temporal clustering algorithm based on a measure of the repetitiveness of the video. User feedback provided us with valuable suggestions for improvements to our system.",

    "Title": "Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction",
    "Abstract": "The combination of two of the twentieth centuryâ€™s most influential and revolutionary scientific theories, information theory and quantum mechanics, gave rise to a radically new view of computing and information. Quantum information processing explores the implications of using quantum mechanics instead of classical mechanics to model information and its processing. Quantum computing is not about changing the physical substrate on which computation is done from classical to quantum but about changing the notion of computation itself, at the most basic level. The fundamental unit of computation is no longer the bit but the quantum bit or qubit. This comprehensive introduction to the field offers a thorough exposition of quantum computing and the underlying concepts of quantum physics, explaining all the relevant mathematics and offering numerous examples. With its careful development of concepts and thorough explanations, the book makes quantum computing accessible to students and professionals in mathematics, computer science, and engineering. A reader with no prior knowledge of quantum physics (but with sufficient knowledge of linear algebra) will be able to gain a fluent understanding by working through the book.\r\n\r\nThe text covers the basic building blocks of quantum information processing, quantum bits and quantum gates, showing their relationship to the key quantum concepts of quantum measurement, quantum state transformation, and entanglement between quantum subsystems; it treats quantum algorithms, discussing notions of complexity and describing a number of simple algorithms as well as the most significant algorithms to date; and it explores entanglement and robust quantum computation, investigating such topics as quantifying entanglement, decoherence, quantum error correction, and fault tolerance.",

With this approach,\r\nusers initially answer questions about the types of\r\nsituations in which they expect to use the product. The interface\r\nreveals the types of products that match their needs\r\nand exposes high-level product features related to the kinds\r\nof tasks in which they have expressed an interest.

We developed\r\nsemi-automatic methods to extract the high-level features\r\nused by the system from online product data.

    "Title": "SUPERVISED LEARNING",
    "Abstract": "Supervised Learning is a machine learning paradigm for acquiring the input-output relationship information\r\nof a system based on a given set of paired input-output training samples. As the output is regarded as the\r\nlabel of the input data or the supervision, an input-output training sample is also called labelled training data,\r\nor supervised data. Occasionally, it is also referred to as Learning with a Teacher (Haykin 1998), Learning\r\nfrom Labelled Data, or Inductive Machine Learning (Kotsiantis, 2007). The goal of supervised learning is to\r\nbuild an artificial system that can learn the mapping between the input and the output, and can predict the\r\noutput of the system given new inputs. If the output takes a finite set of discrete values that indicate the class\r\nlabels of the input, the learned mapping leads to the classification of the input data. If the output takes continuous\r\nvalues, it leads to a regression of the input. The input-output relationship information is frequently\r\nrepresented with learning-model parameters. When these parameters are not directly available from training\r\nsamples, a learning system needs to go through an estimation process to obtain these parameters. Different\r\nform Unsupervised Learning, the training data for Supervised Learning need supervised or labelled information,\r\nwhile the training data for unsupervised learning are unsupervised as they are not labelled (i.e., merely\r\nthe inputs). If an algorithm uses both supervised and unsupervised training data, it is called a Semi-supervised\r\nLearning algorithm. If an algorithm actively queries a user/teacher for labels in the training process, the iterative\r\nsupervised learning is called Active Learning.",

    "Title": "Embedded Media Barcode Links: Optimally Blended Barcode Overlay on Paper for Linking to Associated Media",
    "Abstract": "Embedded Media Barcode Links, or simply EMBLs, are optimally blended iconic barcode marks, printed on paper documents, that signify the existence of multimedia associated with that part of the document content (Figure 1). EMBLs are used for multimedia retrieval with a camera phone. Users take a picture of an EMBL-signified document patch using a cell phone, and the multimedia associated with the EMBL-signified document location is displayed on the phone. Unlike a traditional barcode which requires an exclusive space, the EMBL construction algorithm acts as an agent to negotiate with a barcode reader for maximum user and document benefits. Because of this negotiation, EMBLs are optimally blended with content and thus have less interference with the original document layout and can be moved closer to a media associated location. Retrieval of media associated with an EMBL is based on the barcode identification of a captured EMBL. Therefore, EMBL retains nearly all barcode identification advantages, such as accuracy, speed, and scalability. Moreover, EMBL takes advantage of users' knowledge of a traditional barcode. Unlike Embedded Media Maker (EMM) which requires underlying document features for marker identification, EMBL has no requirement for the underlying features. This paper will discuss the procedures for EMBL construction and optimization. It will also give experimental results that strongly support the EMBL construction and optimization ideas.",

Some papers report on collaborative practices in a range of domains, including medical (Hertzum), legal (Attfield et al.), and online Q&A (Gazan). Others propose and evaluate models of collaborative activity (Evans and Chi; Evans et al.; Wilson and schraefel; Foley and Smeaton), and others describe systems and algorithms that support collaboration in various ways (Boydell and Smyth; Fernandez-Luna et al., Halvey et al., Morris et al.;  Shah et al.).",

    "Abstract": "We describe a new approach for algorithmic mediation of a collaborative search process.\r\nUnlike most approaches to collaborative IR, we are designing systems that mediate explicitly-\r\ndefined synchronous collaboration among small groups of searchers with a shared\r\ninformation need. Such functionality is provided by first obtaining different rank-lists\r\nbased on searchersâ€™ queries, fusing these rank-lists, and then splitting the combined list\r\nto distribute documents among collaborators according to their roles. For the work\r\nreported here, we consider the case of two people collaborating on a search. We assign\r\nthem roles of Gatherer and Surveyor: the Gatherer is tasked with exploring highly promising\r\ninformation on a given topic, and the Surveyor is tasked with digging further to\r\nexplore more diverse information. We demonstrate how our technique provides the Gatherer\r\nwith high-precision results, and the Surveyor with information that is high in entropy.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional interactive information retrieval systems function by creating inverted lists, or term indexes.  For every term in the vocabulary, a list is created that contains the documents in which that term occurs and its relative frequency within each document.  Retrieval algorithms then use these term frequencies alongside other collection statistics to identify the matching documents for a query.  In this paper, we turn the process around: instead of indexing documents, we index query result sets.  First, queries are run through a chosen retrieval system.  For each query, the resulting document IDs are treated as terms and the score or rank of the document is used as the frequency statistic.  An index of documents retrieved by basis queries is created.  We call this index a reverted index.  Finally, with reverted indexes, standard retrieval algorithms can retrieve the matching queries (as results) for a set of documents (used as queries).  These recovered queries can then be used to identify additional documents, or to aid the user in query formulation, selection, and feedback.",

    "Abstract": "FACT is an interactive paper system for fine-grained interaction with documents across the boundary between paper and computers. It consists of a small camera-projector unit, a laptop, and ordinary paper documents. With the camera-projector unit pointing to a paper document, the system allows a user to issue pen gestures on the paper document for selecting fine-grained content and applying various digital functions. For example, the user can choose individual words, symbols, figures, and arbitrary regions for keyword search, copy and paste, web search, and remote sharing. FACT thus enables a computer-like user experience on paper. This paper interaction can be integrated with laptop interaction for cross-media manipulations on multiple documents and views. We present the infrastructure, supporting techniques and interaction design, and demonstrate the feasibility via a quantitative experiment. We also propose applications such as document manipulation, map navigation and remote collaboration. ",

Users take a picture of the EMM using a camera phone, and the media associated with that part of the document is displayed on the phone. Unlike bar codes, EMMs are nearly transparent and thus do not interfere with the document appearance. Retrieval of media associated with an EMM is based on image features of the document within the EMM boundary. Unlike other feature-based retrieval methods, the EMM clearly indicates to the user the existence and type of media associated with the document location. A semi-automatic authoring tool is used to place an EMM at a location in a document, in such a way that it encompasses sufficient identification features with minimal disturbance to the original document. We will demonstrate how to create an EMM-enhanced document, and how the EMM enables access to the associated media on a cell phone.",

    "Abstract": "We will exhibit several aspects of a complex mixed reality system that we have built and deployed in a real-world factory setting. In our system, virtual worlds, augmented realities, and mobile applications are all fed from the same infrastructure. In collaboration with TCHO, a chocolate maker in San Francisco, we built a virtual â€œmirrorâ€ world of a real-world chocolate factory and its processes. Sensor data is imported into the multi-user 3D environment from hundreds of sensors on the factory floor. The resulting virtual factory is used for simulation, visualization, and collaboration, using a set of interlinked, real-time layers of information. Another part of our infrastructure is designed to support appropriate industrial uses for mobile devices such as cell phones and tablet computers. We deployed this system at the real-world factory in 2009, and it is now is daily use there. By simultaneously developing mobile, virtual, and web-based display and collaboration environments, we aimed to create an infrastructure that did not skew toward one type of application but that could serve many at once, interchangeably. Through this mixture of mobile, social, mixed and virtual technologies, we hope to create systems for enhanced collaboration in industrial settings between physically remote people and places, such as factories in China with managers in the US.",

The index is created from words on the presentation slides appearing in the video along with any associated metadata such as the title and abstract when available. The video is analyzed to identify a set of distinct slide images, to which OCR and lexical processes are applied which in turn generate a list of indexable terms. \r\nSeveral problems were discovered when trying to identify\r\ndistinct slides in the video stream. For example, picture-in-picture compositing of a speaker and a presentation slide, switching cameras, and slide builds confuse basic frame-differencing algorithms for extracting keyframe slide images.\r\nAlgorithms are described that improve slide identification.\r\nA prototype system was built to test the algorithms and\r\nthe utility of the search engine.

    "Title": "\"Need to know\" security for data analysis (poster - the abstract will appear in the program)",
    "Abstract": "The massive amounts of information that are being collected about each\r\nof us will only increase as sensors become ever cheaper and more\r\npowerful. Analysis of this wealth of data supports advances in medicine\r\nand public health, improved software and services through user pattern\r\nanalysis, and more efficient economic mechanisms. At the same time, the\r\npotential for misuse of such data is significant. A long-term research\r\nquestion is how best to support beneficial uses while inhibiting misuse.\r\n\r\nOne approach is to enable individuals to maintain tighter control of\r\ntheir own data while still supporting the computation of group\r\nstatistics. Currently, analysts are usually given access to all data in\r\norder to compute statistics, and often use a third party service\r\nprovider to store, or even process, such data. Either the third party\r\nhas access to all data or the data are encrypted, in which case the\r\nthird party does no processing. An interesting research question is how\r\nto provide mechanisms to support \"need to know\" security in which an\r\nindividual has full access to her own data, the third party learns\r\nnothing about the data but can nevertheless contribute to the\r\nprocessing, and the analyst learns only the desired statistics. We have\r\nexplored \"need to know\" security in connection with MyUnity, a prototype awareness system.\r\n\r\nMyUnity collects data from a variety of sources and displays summary\r\npresence states, such as ``in office'' or ``with visitor,'' computed\r\nfrom the received data. MyUnity was deployed in a small research lab and\r\nhas been in use by over 30 people for more than a year.  To avoid\r\nconcerns about misuse, the system did not store any data initially. The\r\nresearchers developing the system were interested, however, in analyzing\r\nusage patterns, and users expressed interest in seeing personal trends,\r\nactivity patterns of coworkers, and long-term data pooled across groups\r\nof users, all requiring data to be stored. At the same time, users\r\ncontinued to be concerned about misuse of stored data. We looked at\r\n``need to know'' security for cases in which, at each time step, each\r\nmember of a group of users has a value (i.e., a presence state) to\r\ncontribute, and the group would like to provide only an aggregate view\r\nof those values to people outside their group.\r\n\r\nWe designed and implemented an efficient protocol that enables each user\r\nto encrypt under her own key in such a way that a third party can\r\ncompute an encryption of a sum across values encrypted under different\r\nkeys without the need for further interactions with the individuals. The\r\nprotocol provides means for an analyst to decrypt the encrypted sum. We\r\ndesigned key structures and extensions to provide a family of efficient\r\nnon-interactive ``need to know'' protocols for time series data in which\r\nthe analyst learns only the statistics, not the individual data values,\r\nand the third party learns nothing about the values.\r\n",

Repeat photography is\r\nfrequently used to observe and document changes in an object.\r\nOur system uses AR technology to estimate camera poses in real\r\ntime. When a user takes a photo, the camera pose is saved as a\r\n'view bookmark.' To support a user in taking a repeat photo, two\r\nsimple graphics are rendered in an AR viewer on the camera's\r\nscreen to guide the user to this bookmarked view. The system then\r\nuses image adjustment techniques to create an image based on the\r\nuser's repeat photo that is even closer to the original.",

    "Abstract": "We present a method for picture detection in document page images, which can come from scanned or camera images, or rendered from electronic file formats.  Our method uses OCR to separate out the text and applies the Normalized Cuts algorithm to cluster the non-text pixels into picture regions.  A refinement step uses the captions found in the OCR text to deduce how many pictures are in a picture region, thereby correcting for under- and over-segmentation.  A performance evaluation scheme is applied which takes into account the detection quality and fragmentation quality. We benchmark our method against the ABBYY application on page images from conference papers.",

It also generates a rich set of data that can be used effectively to reflect on what has been found (and found useful). In this paper, we describe a framework for unifying transitions among various stages of exploratory search, and show how context from one stage can be applied to the next. The framework can be used both to describe existing information-seeking interactions, and as a means of generating novel ones. We illustrate the framework with examples from a session-based exploratory search system prototype that we have built.",

    "Abstract": "Virtual, mobile, and mixed reality systems have diverse uses for data visualization and remote collaboration in industrial settings, especially factories. We report our experiences in designing complex mixed-reality collaboration, control, and display systems for a real-world factory, for delivering real-time factory information to multiple users.\r\nIn collaboration with (blank for review), a chocolate maker in San Francisco, our research group is building a virtual â€œmirrorâ€ world of a real-world chocolate factory and its processes. Real-world sensor data (such as temperature and machine state) is imported into the 3D environment from hundreds of sensors on the factory floor. Multi-camera imagery from the factory is also available in the multi-user 3D factory environment. The resulting \"virtual factory\" is designed for simulation, visualization, and collaboration, using a set of interlinked, real-time 3D and 2D layers of information about the factory and its processes.  \r\nWe are also looking at appropriate industrial uses for mobile devices such as cell phones and tablet computers, and how they intersect with virtual worlds and mixed realities. For example, an experimental iPhone web app provides mobile laboratory monitoring and control. The app allows a real-time view into the lab via steerable camera and remote control of lab machines. The mobile system is integrated with the database underlying the virtual factory world.  \r\nThese systems were deployed at the real-world factory and lab in 2009, and are now in beta development. Through this mashup of mobile, social, mixed and virtual technologies, we hope to create industrial systems for enhanced collaboration between physically remote people and places â€“ for example, factories in China with managers in Japan or the US.     \r\n",

    "Abstract": "Photo libraries are growing in quantity and size, requiring better support for locating desired photographs. MediaGLOW is an interactive visual workspace designed to address this concern. It uses attributes such as visual appearance, GPS locations, user-assigned tags, and dates to filter and group photos. An automatic layout algorithm positions photos with similar attributes near each other to support users in serendipitously finding multiple relevant photos. In addition, the system can explicitly select photos similar to specified photos. We conducted a user evaluation to determine the benefit provided by similarity layout and the relative advantages offered by the different layout similarity criteria and attribute filters. Study participants had to locate photos matching probe statements. In some tasks, participants were restricted to a single layout similarity criterion and filter option. Participants used multiple attributes to filter photos. Layout by similarity without additional filters turned out to be one of the most used strategies and was especially beneficial for geographical similarity. Lastly, the relative appropriateness of the single similarity criterion to the probe significantly affected retrieval performance.",

    "Abstract": "PACER is a gesture-based interactive paper system that\r\nsupports fine-grained paper document content manipulation\r\nthrough the touch screen of a cameraphone. Using the\r\nphoneâ€™s camera, PACER links a paper document to its\r\ndigital version based on visual features. It adopts camera-based\r\nphone motion detection for embodied gestures (e.g.\r\nmarquees, underlines and lassos), with which users can\r\nflexibly select and interact with document details (e.g.\r\nindividual words, symbols and pixels). The touch input is\r\nincorporated to facilitate target selection at fine granularity,and to address some limitations of the embodied\r\ninteraction, such as hand jitter and low input sampling rate. This hybrid interaction is coupled with other techniques such as semi-real time document tracking and loose physical-digital document registration, offering a gesture-based\r\ncommand system. We demonstrate the use of\r\nPACER in various scenarios including work-related\r\nreading, maps and music score playing. A preliminary user\r\nstudy on the design has produced encouraging user\r\nfeedback, and suggested future research for better\r\nunderstanding of embodied vs. touch interaction and one vs.\r\ntwo handed interaction.",

Our two-phase method starts with a free viewing phase during which gaze data is collected. During the next phase, we either segment the image, mask previously seen areas of the image, or combine the two techniques, and repeat the search. We compare the different methods proposed for the second search phase by evaluating the inspection method using true positive and false negative rates, and subjective workload. Results show that gaze-blocked configurations reduced the subjective workload, and that gaze-blocking without segmentation showed the largest increase in true positive identifications and the largest decrease in false negative identifications of previously unseen objects.",

    "Abstract": "Paper is static but it is also light, flexible, robust, and has high resolution for reading documents in various scenarios. Digital devices will likely never match the flexibility of paper, but come with all of the benefits of computation and networking. Tags provide a simple means of bridging the gap between the two media to get the most out of both. In this paper, we explore the tradeoffs between two different types of tagging technologies â€“ marker-based and content-based â€“ through the lens of four systems we have developed and evaluated at our lab. From our experiences, we extrapolate issues for designers to consider when developing systems that transition between paper and digital content in a variety of different scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "Embedded Media Markers, or simply EMMs, are nearly\r\ntransparent iconic marks printed on paper documents that\r\nsignify the existence of media associated with that part of\r\nthe document. EMMs also guide usersâ€™ camera operations\r\nfor media retrieval. Users take a picture of an EMMsignified\r\ndocument patch using a cell phone, and the media\r\nassociated with the EMM-signified document location is\r\ndisplayed on the phone. Unlike bar codes, EMMs are nearly\r\ntransparent and thus do not interfere with the document\r\ncontents. Retrieval of media associated with an EMM is\r\nbased on image local features of the captured EMMsignified\r\ndocument patch. This paper describes a technique\r\nfor semi-automatically placing an EMM at a location in a\r\ndocument, in such a way that it encompasses sufficient\r\nidentification features with minimal disturbance to the\r\noriginal document.",

In mobile environments, an urgent need exists for handling documents using a mobile phone, especially for browsing documents and viewing Rich Contents created on computers. This paper describes Seamless Document Handling, which is a technology for viewing electronic documents and Rich Contents on the small screen of a mobile phone. To enhance operability and readability, we devised a method of scrolling documents efficiently by applying document image processing technology, and designed a novel user interface with a pan-and-zoom technique. We conducted on-site observations to test usability of the prototype, and gained insights difficult to acquire in a lab that led to improved functions in the prototype.",

    "Abstract": "Browsing and searching for documents in large, online enterprise document repositories is an increasingly common problem. While users are familiar and usually satisfied with Internet search results for information, enterprise search has not been as successful because of differences in data types and user requirements. To support users in finding the information they need from electronic and scanned documents in their online enterprise repository, we created an automatic detector for genres such as papers, slides, tables, and photos. Several of those genres correspond roughly to file name extensions but are identified automatically using features of the document. This genre identifier plays an important role in our faceted document browsing and search system. The system presents documents in a hierarchy as typically found in enterprise document collections. Documents and directories are filtered to show only documents matching selected facets and containing optional query terms and to highlight promising directories. Thumbnail images and automatically identified keyphrases help select desired documents.",

Quantum algorithms can perform a select set of tasks vastly more efficiently than any classical algorithm, but for many\r\ntasks it has been proven that quantum algorithms provide no advantage. The breadth of quantum computing applications is still being explored. Major application areas include security and the many fields that would benefit from efficient quantum simulation. The quantum information processing viewpoint provides insight into classical algorithmic issues as well as a deeper understanding of entanglement and other non-classical aspects of quantum physics.",

Our approach seeks to marry scalable â€œmodel-freeâ€ neighborhood-based annotation with accurate boosting-based per-tag modeling. For accelerated neighborhood-based classification, we use a set of spatial data structures as weak classifiers for an arbitrary number of categories. We employ standard edge and color features and an approximation scheme that scales to large training sets. The weak classifier outputs are combined in a tag-dependent fashion via boosting to improve accuracy. The\r\nmethod performs competitively with standard SVM-based per-tag classification with substantially reduced computational requirements. We present multi-label image annotation experiments using data sets of more than two million photos.",

We present PACER, a platform for applications to interact with document details (e.g. individual words, East Asian characters, math symbols, music notes, and user-specified arbitrary image regions) of generic paper documents through a camera phone. With a see-through phone interface, a user can discover symbol recurrences in a document by pointing the phoneâ€™s crosshair to a symbol within a printout. The user can also continuously move the phone over a printout for gestures to copy and email an arbitrary region, or play music notes on the printout.",

Reading content aloud using text-to-speech (TTS) processing can mitigate these problems, but only for content that does not include rich visual information. In this paper, we introduce a new technique, SeeReader, that combines TTS with automatic content recognition and document presentation control that allows users to listen to documents while also being notified of important visual content. Together, these services allow users to read rich documents on mobile devices while maintaining awareness of their visual environment.",

    "Abstract": "The Usable Smart Environment project (USE) aims at designing easy-to-use, highly functional\r\nnext-generation conference rooms. Our first design prototype focuses on creating a \"no wizards\"\r\nroom for an American executive; that is, a room the executive could walk into and use by himself,\r\nwithout help from a technologist. A key idea in the USE framework is that customization is one of the best ways to create a smooth user experience. Since the system needs to fit both with the personal leadership style of the executive and the corporation's meeting culture, we began the design process by exploring the work flow in and around meetings attended by the executive.\r\n\r\nBased on our work flow analysis and the scenarios we developed from it, USE developed a flexible, extensible architecture specifically designed to enhance ease of use in smart environment technologies. The architecture allows customization and personalization of smart environments for particular people and groups, types of work, and specific physical spaces. The first USE room was designed for FXPAL's executive \"Ian\" and installed in Niji, a small executive conference room at FXPAL.\r\n\r\nThe room Niji currently contains two large interactive whiteboards for projection of presentation\r\nmaterial, for annotations using a digital whiteboard, or for teleconferencing; a Tandberg teleconferencing system; an RFID authentication plus biometric identification system; printing via network; a PDA-based simple controller, and a tabletop touch-screen console. The console is used for the USE room control interface, which controls and switches between all of the equipment mentioned above.",

Should: what should a system to support this \"want\" be able to do?<BR>\r\n3. Create: imagine what an instance of this idea might be.<BR>\r\n4. Can: how could this instance be realized in reality?<P>\r\n\r\nWANT: In my ideal work environment, the data I need on everything and everyone should be available at my fingertips, all the time, in many configurations that I can mix-and-match to suit the needs of any task. This includes things like:<P>\r\nâ€¢ documents of all types<BR>\r\nâ€¢ people's status, tasks, and availability<BR>\r\nâ€¢ audio, video, mobile, and virtual world communication channels<BR>\r\nâ€¢ links to the physical world as appropriate, for example sensors delivering factory data, or the state of the machines I use daily in the workplace (printers,\r\nmy PC, conference room systems), or awareness data about my colleagues.<P>\r\n\r\nCAN: How can we approach this problem? Let's consider the creation of a personal interface or instrument for information mashup, capable of interacting with complex data structures, for tuning smart environments, and for exploring worlds both physical and virtual, in\r\nbusiness, social and personal realms. Like any interactive system this idea has two parts: human-facing and system-facing. These can be called Interstitia I (extending human\r\ninteractivity) and Interstitia II (enabling smart environments).",

The meanings associated with the markers come\r\nfrom a markup language that enables the system to create\r\nmodels from a relatively sparse set of markers. This paper\r\ndescribes extensions to our markup language and system that\r\nsupport the creation of interactive virtual objects. Users place\r\nmarkers to define components such as doors and drawers with\r\nwhich an end user of the model can interact. Other interactive\r\nelements, such as controls for color changes or lighting\r\nchoices, are also supported. Pantheia produced a model of a\r\nroom with hinged doors, a cabinet with drawers, doors, and\r\ncolor options, and a railroad track.",

    "Title": "HIGH ACCURACY AND LANGUAGE INDEPENDENT DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL WITH A FAST INVARIANT TRANSFORM",
    "Abstract": "This paper presents a tool and a novel Fast Invariant Transform (FIT) algorithm for language independent e-documents access. The tool enables a person to access an e-document through an informal camera capture of a document hardcopy. It can save people from remembering/exploring numerous directories and file names, or even going through many pages/paragraphs in one document. It can also facilitate peopleâ€™s manipulation of a document or peopleâ€™s interactions through documents. Additionally, the algorithm is useful for binding multimedia data to language independent paper documents. Our document\r\nrecognition algorithm is inspired by the widely known SIFT\r\ndescriptor [4] but can be computed much more efficiently for both descriptor construction and search. It also uses much less storage space than the SIFT approach. By testing our algorithm with randomly scaled and rotated document pages, we can achieve a 99.73% page recognition rate on the 2188-page ICME06 proceedings and 99.9% page recognition rate on a 504-page Japanese math book.",

    "Abstract": "Modern design embraces digital augmentation, especially in the interplay of digital media content and the physical dispersion and handling of information. Based on the observation that small paper memos with sticky backs (such as Post-Its TM) are a powerful and frequently used design tool, we have created Post-Bits, a new interface device with a physical embodiment that can be handled as naturally as paper sticky notes by designers, yet add digital information affordances as well.\r\n\r\nA Post-Bit is a design prototype of a small electronic paper device for handling multimedia content, with interaction control and display in one thin flexible sheet. Tangible properties of paper such as flipping, flexing, scattering, and rubbing are mapped to controlling aspects of the multimedia content such as scrubbing, sorting, or up- or downloading dynamic media (images, video, text). In this paperwe discuss both the design process involved in building a prototype of a tangible interface using new technologies, and how the use of Post-Bits as a tangible design tool can impact two common design tasks: design\r\nideation or brainstorming, and storyboarding for interactive systems or devices.",

This demo shows an application designed for viewing presentations in a mobile situation, and describes the design process that involved on-site observation and informal user testing at our lab. The system generates a user-controllable movie by capturing a slide presentation, extracting active regions of interest using cues from the presenter, and creating pan-and-zoom effects to direct the active regions within a small screen. During playback, the user can simply watch the movie in automatic mode using a minimal amount of effort to operate the application. When more flexible control is needed, the user can switch into manual mode to temporarily focus on specific regions of interest.",

Detail-on-demand video is a form of hypervideo that supports one hyperlink at a time for navigating between video sequences. The Hyper-Hitchcock editor enables authoring of detail-on-demand video without programming and uses video processing to aid in the authoring process. The Hyper-Hitchcock player uses labels and keyframes to support navigation through and back hyperlinks. Hyper-Hitchcock includes techniques for automatically generating hypervideo summaries of one or more videos that take the form of multiple linear summaries of different lengths with links from the shorter to the longer summaries. User studies on authoring and viewing provided insight into the various roles of links in hypervideo and found that player interface design greatly affects people's understanding of hypervideo structure and the video they access.",

    "Title": "Bezel Swipe: Conflict-Free Scrolling and Multiple Selection on Mobile Touch Screen Devices",
    "Abstract": "Zooming user interfaces are increasingly popular on mobile devices\r\n  with touch screens.  Swiping and pinching finger gestures anywhere\r\n  on the screen manipulate the displayed portion of a page, and taps\r\n  open objects within the page.  This makes navigation easy but limits\r\n  other manipulations of objects that would be supported naturally by\r\n  the same gestures, notably cut and paste, multiple selection, and\r\n  drag and drop.  A popular device that suffers from this limitation\r\n  is Apple's iPhone.  In this paper, we present Bezel Swipe, an\r\n  interaction technique that supports multiple selection, cut, copy,\r\n  paste and other operations without interfering with zooming,\r\n  panning, tapping and other pre-defined gestures.  Participants of\r\n  our user study found Bezel Swipe to be a viable alternative to\r\n  direct touch selection.",

    "Abstract": "One of the core challenges now facing smart rooms is supporting realistic, everyday activities. While much research has been done to push forward the frontiers of novel interaction techniques, we argue that technology geared toward widespread adoption requires a design approach that emphasizes straightforward configuration and control, as well as flexibility. We examined the work practices of users of a large, multi-purpose conference room, and designed DICE, a system to help them use the room's capabilities. We describe the design process, and report findings about the system's usability and about people's use of a multi-purpose conference room.",

The system interactively places photos with a spring layout algorithm using similarity measures based on visual, temporal, and geographic features. These similarity \r\nmeasures are also used for the retrieval of additional photos. Unlike traditional spring-based algorithms, our approach provides users with several means to adapt the layout to their tasks. Users can group photos in stacks that in turn attract neighborhoods of similar photos. Neighborhoods partition the workspace by severing connections outside the neighborhood. By placing photos into the same stack, users can express a desired organization that the system can use to learn a neighborhood-specific combination of distances. ",

    "Abstract": "We have developed an interactive video search system that allows the searcher to rapidly assess query results and easily pivot off those results to form new queries. The system is intended to maximize the use of the discriminative power of the human searcher. The typical video search scenario we consider has a single searcher with the ability to search with text and content-based queries. In this paper, we evaluate a new collaborative modification of our search system. Using our system, two or more users with a common information need search together, simultaneously. The collaborative system provides tools, user interfaces and, most importantly, algorithmically-mediated retrieval to focus, enhance and augment the team's search and communication activities. In our evaluations, algorithmic mediation improved the collaborative performance of both retrieval (allowing a team of searchers to find relevant information more efficiently and effectively), and exploration (allowing the searchers to find relevant information that cannot be found while working individually). We present analysis and conclusions from comparative evaluations of the search system.",

Many new interfaces simply tack electronic systems onto existing forms. However, an original physical design for a smart artefact, that integrates new systems as part of the form of the device, can enhance the end-use experience. The Convertible Podium is an experiment in the design of a smart artefact with complex integrated systems for the use of rich media in meeting rooms. It combines the highly designed look and feel of a modern lectern with systems that allow it to serve as a central control station for rich media manipulation. The interface emphasizes tangibility and ease of use in controlling multiple screens, multiple media sources (including mobile devices) and multiple distribution channels, and managing both data and personal representation in remote telepresence.",

    "Abstract": "Reading online poses a number of technological challenges. Advances in technology such as touch screens, light-weight high-power computers, and bi-stable displays have periodically renewed interest in online reading over the last twenty years, only to see that interest decline to a small early-adopter community. The recent release of the Kindle by Amazon is another attempt to create an online reading device. Has publicity surrounding Kindle and other such devices has reached critical mass to allow them to penetrate the consumer market successfully, or will we see a decline in interest over the next couple of years echoing the lifecycle of Softbookâ„¢ and Rocket eBookâ„¢ devices that preceded them? I argue that the true value of online reading lies in supporting activities beyond reading per se: activities such as annotation, reading and comparing multiple documents, transitions between reading, writing and retrieval, etc. Whether the current hardware will be successful in the long term may depend on its abilities to address the reading needs of knowledge workers, not just leisure readers.",

While standard video editing and screen capture tools are useful for some editing tasks, they have two main drawbacks: (1) they require users to import and organize media in a separate interface, and (2) they do not support natural\r\n(or camcorder-like) screen recording, and instead usually require the user to define a specific region or window to record. In this paper we review current screen recording use, and present the PicNTell system, pilot studies, and a new six degree-of-freedom tracker we are developing in response to our findings.",

A large number of fixed video cameras are commonly installed at these locations. While they can be used to observe activity in the retail environment, assigning personnel to this is too time consuming to be valuable for retail analysis. We have developed video processing and visualization techniques that generate presentations appropriate for examining traffic flow and changes in activity at different times of the day. Taking the results of video tracking software as input, our system aggregates activity in different regions of the area being analyzed, determines the average speed of moving objects in the region, and segments time based on significant changes in the quantity and/or location of activity. Visualizations present the results as heat maps to show activity and object counts and average velocities overlaid on the map of the space.",

    "Abstract": "We present an automatic zooming technique that leverages content analysis for viewing a document page on a small display such as a mobile phone or PDA. The page can come from a scanned document (bitmap image) or an electronic document (text and graphics data plus metadata). The page with text and graphics is segmented into regions. For each region, a scale-distortion function is constructed based on image analysis of the signal distortion that occurs at different scales.  During interactive viewing of the document, as the user navigates by moving the viewport around the page, the zoom factor is automatically adjusted by optimizing the scale-distortion functions of the regions visible in the viewport.",

    "Abstract": "Audio monitoring has many applications but also raises pri-\r\nvacy concerns. In an attempt to help alleviate these con-\r\ncerns, we have developed a method for reducing the intelli-\r\ngibility of speech while preserving intonation and the ability to recognize most environmental sounds. The method is based on identifying vocalic regions and replacing the vocal tract transfer function of these regions with the transfer function from prerecorded vowels, where the identity of the replacement vowel is independent of the identity of the spoken syllable. The audio signal is then re-synthesized using the original pitch and energy, but with the modi\fed vocal tract transfer function. We performed an intelligibility study which showed that environmental sounds remained recognizable but speech intelligibility can be dramatically reduced to a 7% word recognition rate.",

    "Abstract": "We introduce the Ranked Feature Fusion framework for information retrieval system design. Typical information retrieval\r\nformalisms such as the vector space model, the best-match model and the language model first combine features (such as\r\nterm frequency and document length) into a unified representation, and then use the representation to rank documents.\r\nWe take the opposite approach: Documents are first ranked by the relevance of a single feature value and are assigned\r\nscores based on their relative ordering within the collection. A separate ranked list is created for every feature\r\nvalue and these lists are then fused to produce a final document scoring. This new ``rank then combine'' approach is\r\nextensively evaluated and is shown to be as effective as traditional ``combine then rank'' approaches.  The model is\r\neasy to understand and contains fewer parameters than other approaches.  Finally, the model is easy to extend\r\n(integration of new features is trivial) and modify. This advantage includes but is not limited to relevance feedback\r\nand distribution flattening.\r\n",

    "Abstract": "The iPhone takes a fresh approach at defining the user interface for\r\nmobile devices, which invites further innovation for new generations\r\nof touch enabled mobile devices.  At the same time, some of its\r\ninteraction designs provide challenges.  For example, swiping gestures\r\ncan be used anywhere on the screen of an iPhone for navigation, no\r\nscroll bars are used.  This makes navigation remarkably seamless and\r\neasy, at the expense of selection tasks that would also be supported\r\nnaturally by the same gestures.  In this demo, we show techniques that\r\nenable both activities simultaneously with minimal interference.  We\r\nalso demonstrate other user interface designs that are driven by the\r\nfeatures and and a desire to overcome the limits of small displays for\r\niPhone-type devices.  This includes diagonal scrolling as a means to\r\nmaximize line width and font size for mobile reading, and a graphical\r\nauthentication method.\r\n\r\n",

This paper gives a generalized model for\r\nCLE that fulfills the requirements of TRE. This model is secure against\r\nadversaries with adaptive trapdoor extraction capabilities for arbitrary\r\nidentifiers, decryption capabilities for arbitrary public keys, and partial\r\ndecryption capabilities. It also supports hierarchical identifiers. We pro-\r\npose a concrete scheme under our generalized model and prove it secure\r\nwithout random oracles, yielding the first strongly-secure SMCLE and\r\nthe first TRE in the standard model. In addition, our technique of partial\r\ndecryption is different from the previous approach.",

The system is intended to maximize the use of the discriminative power of the human searcher. This is accomplished by providing a hierarchical segmentation, streamlined interface, and redundant visual cues throughout. The typical search scenario includes a single searcher with the ability to search with text and content-based queries. In this paper, we evaluate new variations on our basic search system. In particular we test the system using only visual content-based search capabilities, and using paired searchers in a realtime collaboration. We present analysis and conclusions from these experiments.",

    "Abstract": "Collaboration in information seeking, while common in practice, is just being recognized as an important research area. Several studies have documented various collaboration strategies that people have adopted (and adapted), and some initial systems have been built. This field is in its infancy, however. We need to understand which real-world tasks are best suited for collaborative work. We need to extend models of information seeking to accommodate explicit and implicit collaboration. We need to invent a suite of algorithms to mediate search activities. We need to devise evaluation metrics that take into account multiple people's contributions to search.",

    "Abstract": "Conventional wired detection of vital signs limits the\r\nuse of these important physiological parameters by many\r\napplications, such as airport health screening, elder care,\r\nand workplace preventive care. In this paper, we explore\r\ncontact-free heart rate and respiratory rate detection\r\nthrough measuring infrared light modulation emitted near\r\nsuperficial blood vessels or a nasal area respectively. To\r\ndeal with complications caused by subjects' movements,\r\nfacial expressions, and partial occlusions of the skin, we\r\npropose a novel algorithm based on contour segmentation\r\nand tracking, clustering of informative pixels, and dominant\r\nfrequency component estimation. The proposed method\r\nachieves robust subject regions-of-interest alignment and\r\nmotion compensation in infrared video with low SNR. It relaxes\r\nsome strong assumptions used in previous work and\r\nsubstantially improves on previously reported performance.\r\nPreliminary experiments on heart rate estimation for 20\r\nsubjects and respiratory rate estimation for 8 subjects exhibit promising results.",

    "Title": "Context and Observation Driven Latent Variable Model for Human Pose Estimation",
    "Abstract": "Current approaches to pose estimation and tracking can\r\nbe classified into two categories: generative and discriminative. While generative approaches can accurately determine human pose from image observations, they are computationally intractable due to search in the high dimensional human pose space. On the other hand, discriminative approaches do not generalize well, but are computationally efficient. We present a hybrid model that combines the strengths of the two in an integrated learning and inference framework. We extend the Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM) to include an embedding from\r\nobservation space (the space of image features) to the latent space. GPLVM is a generative model, but the inclusion\r\nof this mapping provides a discriminative component,\r\nmaking the model observation driven. Observation Driven\r\nGPLVM (OD-GPLVM) not only provides a faster inference\r\napproach, but also more accurate estimates (compared to\r\nGPLVM) in cases where dynamics are not sufficient for the\r\ninitialization of search in the latent space.\r\n\r\nWe also extend OD-GPLVM to learn and estimate poses\r\nfrom parameterized actions/gestures. Parameterized gestures\r\nare actions which exhibit large systematic variation\r\nin joint angle space for different instances due to difference in contextual variables. For example, the joint angles in a forehand tennis shot are function of the height of the ball (Figure 2). We learn these systematic variations as a function of the contextual variables. We then present an approach to use information from scene/object to provide\r\ncontext for human pose estimation for such parameterized\r\nactions.",

    "Abstract": "Explicit support for collaboration is becoming increasingly important for certain kinds of collection-building activities in digital libraries. In the last few years, several research groups have also pursued various issues related to collaboration during search [4][5][6]. We can represent collaboration in search on two dimensions - synchrony and intent. Asynchronous collaboration means that people are not working on the same problem simultaneously; implicit collaboration occurs when the system uses information from others' use of the system to inform new searches, but does not guarantee consistency of search goals. In this workshop, we are concerned with the top-left quadrant of Figure 1 that represents small groups of people working toward a common goal at the same time. These synchronous, explicit collaborations could occur amongst remotely situated users, each with their own computers, or amongst a co-located group sharing devices; these spatial configurations add yet another dimension to be considered when designing collaborative search systems.",

This model can be used to classify existing systems and to suggest possible opportunities for design in this space.",

These rogue access points are\r\noperated by criminals in an attempt to launch\r\nman-in-the-middle attacks.  We present a simple protection\r\nmechanism against binding to an evil twin.  The mechanism leverages\r\nshort authentication string protocols for the exchange of\r\ncryptographic keys.  The short string verification is performed by\r\nencoding the short strings as a sequence of colors, rendered\r\nsequentially by the user's device and by the designated access point\r\nof the cafe.  The access point must have a light capable of\r\nshowing two colors and must be mounted prominently in a position\r\nwhere users can have confidence in its authenticity.  We conducted a\r\nusability study with patrons in several cafes and participants\r\nfound our protection mechanism very usable.\r\n\r\n",

    "Title": "Exiting the Cleanroom: On Ecological Validity and Ubiquitous Computing",
    "Abstract": "Over the past decade and a half, corporations and academies have invested considerable time and money in the realization of ubiquitous computing. Yet design approaches that yield ecologically valid understandings of ubiquitous computing systems, which can help designers make design decisions based on how systems perform in the context of actual experience, remain rare. The central question underlying this paper is: what barriers stand in the way of real-world, ecologically valid design for ubicomp? Using a literature survey and interviews with 28 developers, we illustrate how issues of sensing and scale cause ubicomp systems to resist iteration, prototype creation, and ecologically valid evaluation. In particular, we found that developers have difficulty creating prototypes that are both robust enough for realistic use and able to handle ambiguity and error, and that they struggle to gather useful data from evaluations either because critical events occur infrequently, because the level of use necessary to evaluate the system is difficult to maintain, or because the evaluation itself interferes with use of the system. We outline pitfalls for developers to avoid as well as practical solutions, and we draw on our results to outline research challenges for the future. Crucially, we do not argue for particular processes, sets of metrics, or intended outcomes but rather focus on prototyping tools and evaluation methods that support realistic use in realistic settings that can be selected according to the needs and goals of a particular developer or researcher.",

The video analysis component performs feature-level foreground segmentation with reliable results even under complex conditions. It incorporates an efficient greedy-search approach for tracking multiple people through occlusion and combines results from individual cameras into multi-camera trajectories. The user interface draws the users' attention to important events that are indexed for easy reference. Different views within the user interface provide spatial information for easier navigation. DOTS, with over twenty video cameras installed in hallways and other public spaces in our office building, has been in constant use for a year.

From this input we construct\r\na 3D model and an enhanced 2D floor plan that are the bases\r\nfor more specific visualization and analysis tools. Foreground\r\nobjects of interest can be placed within these models and dynamically\r\nupdated in real time across camera views. Alternatively,\r\na virtual first-person view suggests what a tracked person\r\ncan see as she moves about. Interactive visualization tools\r\nsupport complex camera-placement tasks. Extrinsic camera\r\ncalibration is supported both by visualizations of parameter\r\nadjustment results and by methods for establishing correspondences\r\nbetween image features and the 3D model.",

DOTS combines video analysis and user interface components to enable security personnel to effectively monitor views of interest and to perform tasks such as tracking a person. The video analysis component performs feature-level foreground segmentation with reliable results even under complex conditions. It incorporates an efficient greedy-search approach for tracking multiple people through occlusion and combines results from individual cameras into multi-camera trajectories. The user interface draws the users' attention to important events that are indexed for easy reference. Different views within the user interface provide spatial information for easier navigation. DOTS, with over twenty video cameras installed in hallways and other public spaces in our office building, has been in constant use for a year. Our experiences led to many changes that improved performance in all system components.",

    "Abstract": "We describe a new interaction technique that allows users to control nonlinear video playback by directly manipulating objects seen in the video. This interaction technique is simi-lar to video \"scrubbing\" where the user adjusts the playback time by moving the mouse along a slider. Our approach is superior to variable-scale scrubbing in that the user can con-centrate on interesting objects and does not have to guess how long the objects will stay in view. Our method relies on a video tracking system that tracks objects in fixed cameras, maps them into 3D space, and handles hand-offs between cameras. In addition to dragging objects visible in video windows, users may also drag iconic object representations on a floor plan. In that case, the best video views are se-lected for the dragged objects.",

    "Abstract": "As more and more tools are developed for meeting support\r\ntasks, properly using these tools to get expected results\r\nbecomes too complicated for many meeting participants. To\r\naddress this problem, we propose POEMS (Paper Offered\r\nEnvironment Management Service) that allows meeting\r\nparticipants to control services in a meeting environment\r\nthrough a digital pen and an environment photo on digital\r\npaper. Unlike state-of-the-art device control interfaces that\r\nrequire interaction with text commands, buttons, or other\r\nartificial symbols, our photo enabled service access is more\r\nintuitive. Compared with PC and PDA supported control,\r\nthis new approach is more flexible and cheap. With this\r\nsystem, a meeting participant can initiate a whiteboard on a\r\nselected public display by tapping the display image in the\r\nphoto, or print out a display by drawing a line from the\r\ndisplay image to a printer image in the photo. The user can\r\nalso control video or other active applications on a display\r\nby drawing a link between a printed controller and the image\r\nof the display.

    "Abstract": "The recent emergence of multi-core processors enables a new trend in the usage of computers. Computer vision applications, which require heavy computation and lots of bandwidth, usually cannot run in real-time. Recent multi-core processors can potentially serve the needs of such workloads. In addition, more advanced algorithms can be developed utilizing the new computation paradigm. In this paper, we study the performance of an articulated body tracker on multi-core processors. The articulated body tracking workload encapsulates most of the important aspects of a computer vision workload. It takes multiple camera inputs of a scene with a single human object, extracts useful features, and performs statistical inference to find the body pose. We show the importance of properly parallelizing the workload in order to achieve great performance: speedups of 26 on 32 cores. We conclude that: (1) data-domain parallelization is better than function-domain parallelization for computer vision applications; (2) data-domain parallelism by image regions and particles is very effective; (3) reducing serial code in edge detection brings significant performance improvements; (4) domain knowledge about low/mid/high level of vision computation is helpful in parallelizing the workload.",

    "Abstract": "A common video surveillance task is to keep track of people moving around the space being monitored. It is often difficult to track activity between cameras because locations such as hallways in office buildings can look quite similar and do not indicate the spatial proximity of the cameras. We describe a spatial video player that orients nearby video feeds with the field of view of the main playing video to aid in tracking between cameras. This is compared with the traditional bank of cameras with and without interactive maps for identifying and selecting cameras. We additionally explore the value of static and rotating maps for tracking activity between cameras. The study results show that both the spatial video player and the map improve user performance when compared to the camera-bank interface. Also, subjects change cameras more often with the spatial player than either the camera bank or the map, when available.",

Given standard low-level features representing each time sample, we build intermediate features via pairwise similarity.  The intermediate features comprehensively characterize local temporal structure, and are input to an efficient supervised classifier to identify shot boundaries. We integrate discriminative feature selection based on mutual information to enhance performance and reduce processing requirements. Experimental results using large-scale test sets provided by the TRECVID evaluations for abrupt and gradual shot boundary detection are presented, demonstrating excellent performance.",

Willis O'Brien, the stop motion genius that animated Kong, pioneered the art of extending, or completely fabricating, scenery. Layering several elements painted on glass in front his puppets and rear projected footage allowed O'brien and RKO's visual effects artist Linwood Dunn to create King Kong's fantastic jungle scenes.

Although the details of various systems differ, content-based recommendation systems share in common a means for describing the items that may be recommended, a means for creating a profile of the user that describes the types of items the user likes, and a means of comparing items to the user profile to determine what to recommend.  The user profile is often created and updated automatically in response to feedback on the desirability of items that have been presented to the user.",

    "Abstract": "Current search engines crawl the Web, download content, and digest this content locally. For multimedia content, this involves considerable volumes of data. Furthermore, this process covers only publicly available content because content providers are concerned that they otherwise loose control over the distribution of their intellectual property. We present the prototype of our secure and distributed search engine, which dynamically pushes content based feature extraction to image providers. Thereby, the volume of data that is transported over the network is significantly reduced, and the concerns mentioned above are alleviated. The distribution of feature extraction and matching algorithms is done by mobile software agents. Subsequent search requests performed upon the resulting feature indices by means of remote feature comparison can either be realized through mobile software agents, or by the use of implicitly created Web services which wrap the remote comparison functionality, and thereby improve the interoperability of the search engine. We give a description of the search engine's architecture and implementation, depict our concepts to integrate agent and Web service technology, and present quantitative evaluation results. Furthermore, we discuss related security mechanisms for content protection and server security.",

This is due to inherent support for code mobility by means of dynamic class loading and separable class name spaces, as well as a number of security properties, such as language safety and access control by means of stack introspection. However, serious questions must be raised whether Java is actually up to the task of providing a secure execution environment for mobile agents. At the time of writing, it has neither resource control nor proper application separation. In this article we take an in-depth look at Java as a foundation for secure mobile agent systems.",

    "Title": "A Collaborative Approach to Stochastic Load Balancing with Networked Queues of Autonomous Service Clusters",
    "Abstract": "Load balancing has been an increasingly important issue for handling computational intensive tasks in a distributed system such as in Grid and cluster computing. In such systems, multiple server instances are installed for handling requests from client applications, and each request (or task) typically needs to stay in a queue before an available server is assigned to process it. In this paper, we propose a high-performance queueing method for implementing a shared queue for collaborative clusters of servers. Each cluster of servers maintains a local queue and queues of different clusters are networked to form a unified (or shared) queue that may dispatch tasks to all available servers. We propose a new randomized algorithm for forwarding requests in an overcrowded local queue to a networked queue based on load information of the local and neighboring clusters.  The algorithm achieves both load balancing and locality awareness.",

The notion is that the\r\nmore often a query term occurs in a document, the more likely it is that document meets an information need. We examine an alternative. We propose a model which assesses the presence of a term in a document not by looking at the actual occurrence of that term, but by a set of nonindependent supporting terms, i.e. context. This yields a weighting for terms in documents which is different from and complementary to tf-based methods, and is beneficial for retrieval.",

    "Abstract": "Video surveillance systems have become common across a wide number of environments.  While these installations have included more video streams, they also have been placed in contexts with limited personnel for monitoring the video feeds.  In such settings, limited human attention, combined with the quantity of video, makes it difficult for security personnel to identify activities of interest and determine interrelationships between activities in different video streams. We have developed applications to support security personnel both in analyzing previously recorded video and in monitoring live video streams.  For recorded video, we created storyboard visualizations that emphasize the most important activity as heuristically determined by the system.  We also developed an interactive multi-channel video player application that connects camera views to map locations, alerts users to unusual and suspicious video, and visualizes unusual events along a timeline for later replay.  We use different analysis techniques to determine unusual events and to highlight them in video images.  These tools aid security personnel by directing their attention to the most important activity within recorded video or among several live video streams.\r\n",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a method for facilitating document\r\nredirection in a physical environment via a mobile camera.\r\nWith this method, a user is able to move documents among\r\nelectronic devices, post a paper document to a selected\r\npublic display, or make a printout of a white board with\r\nsimple point-and-capture operations. More specifically, the\r\nuser can move a document from its source to a destination\r\nby capturing a source image and a destination image in a\r\nconsecutive order. The system uses SIFT (Scale Invariant\r\nFeature Transform) features of captured images to identify\r\nthe devices a user is pointing to, and issues corresponding\r\ncommands associated with identified devices. Unlike RF/IR\r\nbased remote controls, this method uses object visual\r\nfeatures as an all time 'transmitter' for many tasks, and\r\ntherefore is easy to deploy. We present experiments on\r\nidentifying three public displays and a document scanner in\r\na conference room for evaluation.",

    "Title": "Usable ubiquitous computing in next generation conference rooms:  design, architecture and evaluation",
    "Abstract": "In the UbiComp 2005 workshop \"Ubiquitous computing in next generation conference rooms\" we learned that usability is one of the primary challenges in these spaces.  Nearly all \"smart\" rooms, though they often have interesting and effective functionality, are very difficult to simply walk in and use. Most such rooms have resident experts who keep the room's systems functioning, and who often must be available on an everyday basis to enable the meeting technologies. The systems in these rooms are designed for and assume the presence of these human \"wizards\"; they are seldom designed with usability in mind.  In addition, people don't know what to expect in these rooms; as yet there is no technology standard for next-generation conference rooms. \r\n\r\nThe challenge here is to strike an effective balance between usability and new kinds of functionality (such as multiple displays, new interfaces, rich media systems, new uploading/access/security systems, robust mobile integration, to name just a few of the functions we saw in last year's workshop).  So, this year, we propose a workshop to focus more specifically on how the design of next-generation conference rooms can support usability: the tasks facing the real people who use these rooms daily.  \r\n\r\nUsability in ubiquitous computing has been the topic of several papers and workshops.  Focusing on usability in next-generation conference rooms lets us bring to bear some of the insights from this prior work in a delineated application space. In addition the workshop will be informed by the most recent usability research in ubiquitous computing, rich media, context-aware mobile systems, multiple display environments, and interactive physical environments.  We also are vitally concerned with how usability in smart environments tracks (or doesn't) across cultures.\r\n\r\nConference room research has been and remains a focal point for some of the most interesting and applied work in ubiquitous computing. It is also an area where there are many real-world applications and daily opportunities for user feed-back: in short, a rich area for exploring usable ubiquitous computing.  We see a rich opportunity to draw together researchers not only from conference room research but also from areas such as interactive furniture/smart environments, rich media, social computing, remote conferencing, and mobile devices for a lively exchange of ideas on usability in applied ubicomp systems for conference rooms.\r\n",

Most surveillance systems consist of multiple video streams, but traditional event detection systems treat individual video streams independently or combine them in the feature extraction level through geometric reconstruction. Our framework combines multiple video streams in the inference level, with a coupled hidden Markov Model (CHMM). We use two-stage training to bootstrap a set of usual events, and train a CHMM over the set. By thresholding the likelihood of a test segment being generated by the model, we build a unusual event detector.\r\n\r\nWe evaluate the performance of our detector through qualitative and quantitative experiments on two sets of real world videos.

    "Abstract": "This chapter describes tools for browsing and searching through video\r\nto enable users to quickly locate video passages of interest. Digital video databases\r\ncontaining large numbers of video programs ranging from several minutes to several\r\nhours in length are becoming increasingly common. In many cases, it is not sufficient\r\nto search for relevant videos, but rather to identify relevant clips, typically less than\r\none minute in length, within the videos. We offer two approaches for finding information\r\nin videos. The first approach provides an automatically generated interactive\r\nmulti-level summary in the form of a hypervideo. When viewing a sequence of short\r\nvideo clips, the user can obtain more detail on the clip being watched. For situations\r\nwhere browsing is impractical, we present a video search system with a flexible user\r\ninterface that incorporates dynamic visualizations of the underlying multimedia objects.\r\nThe system employs automatic story segmentation, and displays the results\r\nof text and image-based queries in ranked sets of story summaries. Both approaches\r\nhelp users to quickly drill down to potentially relevant video clips and to determine\r\nthe relevance by visually inspecting the material.",

    "Abstract": "Technology-the collection of devices and methods available to human society-evolves by\r\nconstructing new devices and methods from ones that previously exist, and in turn offering these as\r\npossible components-building blocks-for the construction of further new devices and elements.\r\nThe collective of technology in this way forms a network of elements where novel elements are\r\ncreated from existing ones and where more complicated elements evolve from simpler ones. We\r\nmodel this evolution within a simple artificial system on the computer. The elements in our system\r\nare logic circuits. New elements are formed by combination from simpler existing elements\r\n(circuits), and if a novel combination satisfies one of a set of needs it is retained as a building block\r\nfor further combination. We study the properties of the resulting buildout. We find that our\r\nartificial system can create complicated technologies (circuits), but only by first creating simpler\r\nones as building blocks. Our results mirror Lenski et al.'s, that complex features can be created in\r\nbiological evolution only if simpler functions are first favored and act as stepping stones. We also\r\nfind evidence that the resulting collection of technologies exists at self-organized criticality.",

    "Abstract": "In a landmark article, over a half century ago, Vannevar Bush envisioned a \"Memory Extender\" device he dubbed the \"memex\". Bush's ideas anticipated and inspired numerous breakthroughs, including hypertext, the Internet, the World Wide Web, and Wikipedia. However, despite these triumphs, the memex has still not lived up to its potential in corporate settings. One reason is that corporate users often don't have sufficient time or incentives to contribute to a corporate memory or to explore others' contributions. At FXPAL, we are investigating ways to automatically create and retrieve useful corporate memories without any added burden on anyone. In this paper we discuss how ProjectorBox a smart appliance for automatic presentation capture and PAL Bar a system for proactively retrieving contextually relevant corporate memories have enabled us to integrate content from a variety of sources to create a cohesive multimedia corporate memory for our organization.",

    "Abstract": "During grouping tasks for data exploration and sense-making, the criteria are normally not well-defined. When users are bringing together data objects thought to be similar in some way, implicit brushing continually detects for groups on the freeform workspace, analyzes the groups' text content or metadata, and draws attention to related data by displaying visual hints and animation. This provides helpful tips for further grouping, group meaning refinement and structure discovery. The sense-making process is further enhanced by retrieving relevant information from a database or network during the brushing. Closely related to implicit brushing, target snapping provides a useful means to move a data object to one of its related groups on a large display. Natural dynamics and smooth animations also help to prevent distractions and allow users to concentrate on the grouping and thinking tasks. Two different prototype applications, note grouping for brainstorming and photo browsing, demonstrate the general applicability of the technique.",

    "Abstract": "Routing algorithms such as Distance Vector and Link States have the routing table size as O(n), where n is the number of destination identifiers, thus providing only limited scalability for large networks when n is high. As the distributed hash table (DHT) techniques are extraordinarily scalable with n, our work aims at adapting a DHT approach to the design of a network-layer routing algorithm so that the average routing table size can be significantly reduced to O(log n) without losing much routing efficiency. Nonetheless, this scheme requires a major breakthrough to address some fundamental challenges. Specifically, unlike a DHT, a network-layer routing algorithm must (1) exchange its control messages without an underlying network, (2) handle link insertion/deletion and link-cost updates, and (3) provide routing efficiency. Thus, we are motivated to propose a new network-layer routing algorithm, Tunnel Vector (TV), using DHT-like multilevel routing without an underlying network. TV exchanges its control messages only via physical links and is self-configurable in response to linkage updates. In TV, the routing path of a packet is near optimal while the routing table size is O(log n) per node, with high probability. Thus, TV is suitable for routing in a very large network.",

    "Title": "\"It's Just A Method!\"  A Pedagogical Experiment in Interdisciplinary Design",
    "Abstract": "What does a student need to know to be a designer? Beyond  a list of separate skills, what mindset does a student need to develop for designerly action now and into the future? In the excitement of the cognitive revolution, Simon proposed a way of thinking about design that promised to make it more manageable and cognitive: to think of design as a planning problem.  Yet, as Suchman argued long ago, planning accounts may be applied to problems that are not at base accomplished by planning, to the detriment of design vision. This paper reports on a pedagogy that takes Suchman's criticism to heart and avoids dressing up design methods as more systematic and predictive than they in fact are. The idea is to teach design through expo-sure to not just one, but rather, many methods---that is, sets of rules or behaviors that produce artifacts for further reflec-tion and development. By introducing a large number of design methods, decoupled from theories, models or frame-works, we teach (a) important cross-methodological regu-larities in competence as a designer, (b) that the practice of design can itself be designed and (c) that method choice affects design outcomes. This provides a rich and produc-tive notion of design particularly necessary for the world of pervasive and ubiquitous computing. ",

    "Abstract": "Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) models have been shown to provide a better model for capturing polysemy and synonymy than Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).  However, the parameters of a PLSA model are trained using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and as a result, the trained model is dependent on the initialization values so that performance can be highly variable.  In this paper we present a method for using LSA analysis to initialize a PLSA model.  We also investigated the performance of our method for the tasks of text segmentation and retrieval on personal-size corpora, and present results demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approach.",

Using local namespaces instead of a global namespace can avoid excessive dissemination of organizational information, reduce maintenance costs, and improve robustness against external security attacks. GIN can forward a query with an O(1) latency stretch with high probability and achieve high performance. In the absence of a complete distance map, its heuristic algorithms for self configuration are scalable and efficient. Routing tables are maintained using soft-state mechanisms for fault tolerance and adapting to performance updates of network distances. Thus, GIN has significant new advantages for building an efficient and scalable Distributed Hash Table for modern collaborative applications across organizations.",

    "Title": "Framework for effective use of multiple displays",
    "Abstract": "Meeting environments, such as conference rooms, executive briefing centers, and exhibition spaces, are now commonly\r\nequipped with multiple displays, and will become increasingly display-rich in the future. Existing authoring /\r\npresentation tools such as PowerPoint, however, provide little support for effective utilization of multiple displays. Even\r\nusing advanced multi-display enabled multimedia presentation tools, the task of assigning material to displays is tedious\r\nand distracts presenters from focusing on content.\r\nThis paper describes a framework for automatically assigning presentation material to displays, based on a model of the\r\nquality of views of audience members. The framework is based on a model of visual fidelity which takes into account\r\npresentation content, audience members' locations, the limited resolution of human eyes, and display location,\r\norientation, size, resolution, and frame rate. The model can be used to determine presentation material placement\r\nbased on average or worst case audience member view quality, and to warn about material that would be illegible.\r\nBy integrating this framework with a previous system for multi-display presentation [PreAuthor, others], we created a\r\ntool that accepts PowerPoint and/or other media input files, and automatically generates a layout of material onto\r\ndisplays for each state of the presentation. The tool also provides an interface allowing the presenter to modify the\r\nautomatically generated layout before or during the actual presentation. This paper discusses the framework, possible\r\napplication scenarios, examples of the system behavior, and our experience with system use.",

From videos, Manga storyboards with keyframe images are created and shown on the faÃ§ade; from slides and text, thumbnail images are produced and subsampled for display on the building sides. The images resemble windows on a building and can be selected for media playback.

    "Title": "Okapi-Chamfer Matching for Articulate Object Recognition",
    "Abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rise of many effective text information retrieval systems. By treating local visual features as terms, training images as documents and input images as queries, we formulate the problem of object recognition into that of text retrieval. Our formulation opens up the opportunity to integrate some powerful text retrieval tools with computer vision techniques. In this paper, we propose to improve the efficiency of articulated object recognition by an Okapi-Chamfer matching algorithm. The algorithm is based on the inverted index technique.\r\n\r\nThe inverted index is a widely used way to effectively organize a collection of text documents. With the inverted index, only documents that contain query terms are accessed and used for matching. To enable inverted indexing in an image database, we build a lexicon of local visual features by clustering the features extracted from the training images. Given a query image, we extract visual features and quantize them based on the lexicon, and then look up the inverted index to identify the subset of training images with non-zero matching score. To evaluate the matching scores in the subset, we combined the modified Okapi weighting formula with the Chamfer distance. The performance of the Okapi-Chamfer matching algorithm is evaluated on a hand posture recognition system. We test the system with both synthesized and real world images. Quantitative results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency our system. ",

It targets applications such as classroom lectures and video conferencing. For capturing panoramic video, we use the FlyCam system that produces high resolution, wide-angle video by stitching video images from multiple stationary cameras. To generate conventional video, a region of interest (ROI) can be cropped from the panoramic video. We propose methods for ROI detection, tracking, and virtual camera control that work in both the uncompressed and compressed domains. The ROI is located from motion and color information in the uncompressed domain and macroblock information in the compressed domain, and tracked using a Kalman filter. This results in virtual camera control that simulates human controlled video recording. The system has no physical camera motion and the virtual camera parameters are readily available for video indexing.",

    "Abstract": "Designing the technologies, applications, and physical spaces for next-generation conference rooms \r\n\r\n(This is a day-long workshop in Tokyo.)\r\n\r\nNext-generation conference rooms are often designed to anticipate the onslaught of new rich media presentation and ideation systems. Throughout the past couple of decades, many researchers have attempted to reinvent the conference room, aiming at shared online or visual/virtual spaces, smart tables or walls, media support and tele-conferencing systems of varying complexity. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCurrent research in high-end room systems often features a multiplicity of thin, bright display screens (both large and small), along with interactive whiteboards, robotic cameras, and smart remote conferencing systems. Added into the mix one can find a variety of meeting capture and metadata management systems, automatic or not, focused on capturing different aspects of meetings in different media: to the Web, to one's PDA or phone, or to a company database. Smart spaces and interactive furniture design projects have shown systems embedded in tables, podiums, walls, chairs and even floors and lighting. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExploiting the capabilities of all these technologies in one room, however, is a daunting task. For example, faced with three or more display screens, all but a few presenters are likely to opt for simply replicating the same image on all of them. Even more daunting is the design challenge: how to choose which capabilities are vital to particular tasks, or for a particular room, or are well suited to a particular culture. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn this workshop we'll explore how the design of next-generation conference rooms can be informed by the most recent research in rich media, context-aware mobile systems, ubiquitous displays, and interactive physical environments. How should conference room systems reflect the rapidly changing expectations around personal devices and smart spaces? What kinds of systems are needed to support meetings in technologically complex environments? How can design of conference room spaces and technologies account for differing social and cultural practices around meetings? What requirements are imposed by security and privacy issues in public spaces? What aspects of meeting capture and access technologies have proven to be useful, and how should a smart environment enable them? What intersections exist with other research areas such as digital libraries? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConference room research has been and remains a focal point for some of the most interesting and applied work in ubiquitous computing. What lessons can we take from the research to date as we move forward? We are confident that a lively and useful discussion will be engendered by bringing directions from recent ubicomp research in games, multimedia applications, and social software to ongoing research in conference rooms systems: integrating architecture and tangible media, information design and display, and mobile and computer-mediated communications.\r\n",

    "Title": "The Convertible Podium:  \r\nA rich media teaching tool for next-generation classrooms\r\n",
    "Abstract": "The Convertible Podium is a central control station for rich media in next-generation classrooms.  It integrates flexible control systems for multimedia software and hardware, and is designed for use in classrooms with multiple screens, multiple media sources and multiple distribution channels.  The built-in custom electronics and unique convertible podium frame allows intuitive conversion between use modes (either manual or automatic). The at-a-touch sound and light control system gives control over the classroom environment. Presentations can be pre-authored for effective performance, and quickly altered on the fly. The counter-weighted and motorized conversion system allows one person to change modes simply by lifting the top of the Podium to the correct position for each mode.\r\n\r\nThe Podium is lightweight, mobile, and wireless, and features an onboard 21\" LCD display, document cameras and other capture devices, tangible controls for hardware and software, and also possesses embedded RFID sensing for automatic data retrieval and file management. It is designed to ease the tasks involved in authoring and presenting in a rich media classroom, as well as supporting remote telepresence and integration with other mobile devices.  \r\n",

    "Abstract": "We developed and studied an experimental system, RealTourist, which lets a user to plan a conference trip with the help of a remote tourist consultant who could view the tourist's eye-gaze superimposed onto a shared\r\nmap. Data collected from the experiment were analyzed in conjunction with literature review on speech and eye-gaze patterns. This inspective, exploratory research identified various functions of gaze-overlay on shared spatial material including: accurate and direct display of partner's eye-gaze, implicit deictic referencing, interest detection, common focus and topic switching, increased\r\nredundancy and ambiguity reduction, and an increase of assurance, confidence, and understanding. This study serves two purposes. The first is to identify patterns that can serve as a basis for designing multimodal human-computer dialogue systems with eye-gaze locus as a contributing channel. The second is to investigate how computer-mediated communication can be supported by the\r\ndisplay of the partner's eye-gaze.",

    "Title": "A Synergistic Approach to Efficient Interactive Video Retrieval",
    "Abstract": "A video database can contain a large number of videos ranging from several minutes to several hours in length. Typically, it is not sufficient to search just for relevant videos, because the task still remains to find the relevant clip, typically less than one minute of length, within the video. This makes it important to direct the users attention to the most promising material and to indicate what material they already investigated. Based on this premise, we created a video search system with a powerful and flexible user interface that incorporates dynamic visualizations of the underlying multimedia objects. The system employes an automatic story segmentation, combines text and visual search, and displays search results in ranked sets of story keyframe collages. By adapting the keyframe collages based on query relevance and indicating which portions of the video have already been explored, we enable users to quickly find relevant sections. We tested our system as part of the NIST TRECVID interactive search evaluation, and found that our user interface enabled users to find more relevant results within the allotted time than other systems employing more sophisticated analysis techniques but less helpful user interfaces.",

This paper describes the 3D Syllabus system, which is designed to visualize indexes to multimedia training content along with the information structures. A double-sided landscape with balloons and cubes represents the personal and group indexes, respectively. The 2D ground plane organizes the indexes as a table and the third dimension of height indicates their importance scores. Additional visual properties of the balloons and cubes provide other information about the indexes and their content. Paths are\r\nrepresented by pipes connecting the balloons. A reliminary evaluation of the 3D Syllabus prototype suggests that it is more efficient than a typical training CD-ROM and is more enjoyable to use.",

Rather than simply tacking electronics onto existing furniture or other objects, the design of a smart object can enhance existing ap-plications in unexpected ways.  The Convertible Podium is an experiment in the design of a smart object with complex integrated systems, combining the highly designed look and feel of a modern lectern with systems that allow it to serve as a central control station for rich media manipulation in next-generation confer-ence rooms.  It enables easy control of multiple independent screens, multiple media sources (including mobile devices) and multiple distribution channels. The Podium is designed to ease the tasks involved in authoring and presenting in a rich media meeting room, as well as supporting remote telepresence and in-tegration with mobile devices. ",

Post-Bits are modeled after paper Post-Itsâ„¢; the functions of each Post-Bit combine the affordances of physical tiny sticky memos and digital handling of information.  Post-Bits enable us to arrange multimedia contents in our embodied physical spaces. Tangible properties of paper such as flipping, flexing, scattering and rubbing are mapped to controlling aspects of the content. In this paper, we introduce the integrated design and functionality of the Post-Bit system, including four main components:  the ePaper sticky memo/player, with integrated sensors and connectors; a small container/binder that a few Post-Bits can fit into, for ordering and multiple connections; the data and power port that allows communication with the host com-puter; and finally the software and GUI interface that reside on the host PC and manage multimedia transfer.",

The editor includes a workspace to select, group, and arrange video clips into several linear sequences. Navigational links placed between the video elements are assigned labels and return behaviors appropriate to the goals of the hypervideo and the role of the destination video. Hyper-Hitchcock was used by students in a Computers and New Media class to author hypervideos on a variety of topics. The produced hypervideos provide examples of hypervideo structures and the link properties and behaviors needed to support them. Feedback from students identified additional link behaviors and features required to support new hypervideo genres. This feedback is valuable for the redesign of Hyper-Hitchcock and the design of hypervideo editors in general.",

    "Abstract": "Organizing digital photograph collections according to events such as holiday gatherings or vacations is a common practice among photographers. To support photographers in this task, we present similarity-based methods to cluster digital photos by time and image content.  The approach is general, unsupervised, and makes minimal assumptions regarding the structure or statistics of the photo collection.  We present several variants of an automatic unsupervised algorithm to partition a collection of digital photographs based either on temporal similarity alone, or on temporal and content-based similarity. First, inter-photo similarity is quantified at multiple temporal scales to identify likely event clusters. Second, the final clusters are determined according to one of three clustering goodness criteria.  The clustering criteria trade off computational complexity and performance. We also describe a supervised clustering method based on learning vector quantization. Finally, we review the results of an experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms and existing approaches on two test collections.",

Text transcripts do not always provide an accurate index to the visual content, and the performance of visually based semantic extraction techniques is often inadequate for search tasks. The searcher must be relied upon to provide detailed judgment of the relevance of specific video segments. We describe a video search system that facilitates this user task by efficiently presenting search results in semantically meaningful units to simplify exploration of query results\r\nand query reformulation. We employ a story segmentation system and\r\nsupporting user interface elements to effectively present query results at\r\nthe story level. The system was tested in the 2004 TRECVID interactive\r\nsearch evaluations with very positive results.",

    "Title": "AN ONLINE VIDEO COMPOSITION SYSTEM",
    "Abstract": "This paper presents an information-driven online video composition system.  The composition work handled by the system includes dynamically setting multiple pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) cameras to proper poses and selecting the best close-up view for passive viewers.  The main idea of the composition system is to maximize captured video information with limited cameras.  Unlike video composition based on heuristic rules, our video composition is formulated as a process of minimizing distortions between ideal signals (i.e. signals with infinite spatial-temporal resolution) and displayed signals.  The formulation is consistent with many well-known empirical approaches widely used in previous systems and may provide analytical explanations to those approaches.  Moreover, it provides a novel approach for studying video composition tasks systematically.  The composition system allows each user to select a personal close-up view.  It manages PTZ cameras and a video switcher based on both signal characteristics and users' view selections.  Additionally, it can automate the video composition process based on past users' view-selections when immediate selections are not available.  We demonstrate the performance of this system with real meetings.",

With existing methods of keyframe selection, similar video segments result in very similar keyframes, with the drawback that  actual differences between the segments may be obscured. We present methods for keyframe selection based on two criteria: capturing the similarity to the represented segment, and\r\npreserving the differences from other segment keyframes, so that different segments will have visually distinct representations. We present two discriminative keyframe\r\nselection methods, and an example of experimental results.",

The system is designed for users such as intelligence analysts that need to quickly find video clips relevant to a topic expressed in text and images. A key component of the system is a powerful and flexible user interface that incorporates dynamic visualizations of the underlying multimedia objects. The interface displays search results in ranked sets of story keyframe collages, and lets users explore the shots in a story. By adapting the keyframe collages based on query relevance and indicating which portions of the video have already been explored, we enable users to quickly find relevant sections. We tested our system as part of the NIST TRECVID interactive search evaluation, and found that our user interface enabled users to find more relevant results within the allotted time than those of many systems employing more sophisticated analysis techniques.",

    "Abstract": "Proactive contextual information systems help people locate information by automatically suggesting potentially relevant resources based on their current tasks or interests. Such systems are becoming increasingly popular, but designing user interfaces that effectively communicate recommended information is a challenge: the interface must be unobtrusive, yet communicate enough information at the right time to provide value to the user. In this paper we describe our experience with the FXPAL Bar, a proactive information system designed to provide contextual access to corporate and personal resources. In particular, we present three features designed to communicate proactive recommendations more effectively: translucent recommendation windows increase the user's awareness of particularly highly-ranked recommendations, query term highlighting communicates the relationship between a recommended document and the user's current context, and a novel recommendation digest function allows users to return to the most relevant previously recommended resources. We present empirical evidence supporting our design decisions and relate lessons learned for other designers of contextual recommendation systems.",

This paper presents several systems that\r\nuse video as an active interface, allowing remote devices and information\r\nto be accessed \"through the screen.\" For example, SPEC enables collaborative\r\nand automatic camera control through an active video window.\r\nThe NoteLook system allows a user to grab an image from a computer\r\ndisplay, annotate it with digital ink, then drag it to that or a different\r\ndisplay. The ePIC system facilitates natural control of multi-display and\r\nmulti-device presentation spaces, while the iLight system allows remote\r\nusers to \"draw\" with light on a local object. All our systems serve as\r\nplatforms for researching more sophisticated algorithms to support additional\r\nfunctionality and ease of use.",

Our tools augment content with metadata that reflect people's reading of content - captured video clips of who's reading and interacting with content, tools to allow people to leave explicit freehand annotations about content, and a visualization of the content access history to show when content is interacted with.

In this demonstration, we present a semi-automatic approach that opportunistically takes advantage of the current state-of-the-art technology in face detection and recognition and combines it with user interface techniques to facilitate the task of labeling people in photos. We show how we use an accurate face detector to automatically extract faces from photos. Instead of having a less accurate face recognizer classify faces, we use it to sort faces by their similarity to a face model. We demonstrate our photo application that uses the extracted faces as UI proxies for actions on the underlying photos along with the sorting strategy to identify candidate faces for quick and easy face labeling.",

The\r\niLight system is a camera/projector system designed for remote collaboration. Using a familiar digital drawing interface, remote users \"draw\" on a live video image of a real-life object or scene. Graphics drawn by the user are then projected onto the scene, where they are visible in the camera image. Because camera distortions are corrected and the video is aligned with the image canvas, drawn graphics appear exactly where desired. Thus the remote users may\r\nharmlessly mark a physical object to serve their own their\r\nartistic and/or expressive needs. We also describe how local\r\nparticipants may interact with remote users through the\r\nprojected images. Besides the intrinsic \"neat factor\" of action at a distance, this installation serves as an experiment in how multiple users from different locales and cultures can create a social space that interacts with a physical one, as well as raising issues of free expression in a non-destructive context.",

    "Abstract": "With digital still cameras, users can easily collect thousands of photos. We have created a photo management application with the goal of making photo organization and browsing simple and quick, even for very large collections. A particular concern is the management of photos depicting people. We present a semi-automatic approach designed to facilitate the task of labeling photos with people that opportunistically takes advantage of the strengths of current state-of-the-art technology in face detection and recognition. In particular, an accurate face detector is used to automatically extract faces from photos while the less accurate face recognizer is used not to classify the detected faces, but to sort faces by their similarity to a chosen model. This sorting is used to present candidate faces within a user interface designed for quick and easy face labeling. We present results of a simulation of the usage model that demonstrate the improved ease that is achieved by our method.",

However, this trend has not been coupled with the development of cues and browsing mechanisms for the social space. On the flip side, active contributors to social spaces (i.e., Web communities) lack the means to present a public face to visitors that can be important for social organizations. Social browsers that combine social visualization and tools can enable newcomers and visitors to view and explore  information and patterns. We present two social browsers for two Web communities. The CHIplace People browser provides an abstract graphical view of the CHIplace community based on the self-described work roles of its membership. The Portkey eTree browser uses a life-like tree ecosystem metaphor to reflect the people, activities and discussions occurring on the Portkey Web site.",

    "Title": "Saving Private Hypertext: Requirements and pragmatic dimensions for preservation",
    "Abstract": "The preservation of literary hypertexts presents significant challenges if we are to ensure continued access to them as the underlying technology changes. Not only does such an effort involve standard digital preservation problems of representing and refreshing metadata, any constituent media types, and structure; hypertext preservation poses additional dimensions that arise from the work's on-screen appearance, its interactive behavior, and the ways a reader's interaction with the work is recorded. In this paper, we describe aspects of preservation introduced by literary hypertexts such as the need to reproduce their modes of interactivity and their means of capturing and using records of reading. We then suggest strategies for addressing the pragmatic dimensions of hypertext preservation and discuss their status within existing digital preservation schemes. Finally, we examine the possible roles various stakeholders within and outside of the hypertext community might assume, including several social and legal issues that stem from preservation.",

More specifically, we discuss how discourse segmentation, sentence-level discourse parsing, and text-level discourse parsing depend on the relationship between sentential syntax and discourse. Specific discourse rules that use syntactic information are used to identify possible attachment points and attachment relations for each Basic Discourse Unit to the DPT. ",

A morphological grouping technique is described for finding 3D regions of high activity or motion from a video embedded in x-y-t space. These regions determine areas in the keyframes, which can be subsumed in a more general geometric framework of germs and supports: germs are the areas of interest, and supports give the context. Algorithms for packing and laying out the germs are provided. Gaps between the germs are filled using a Voronoi-based method. Irregular shapes emerge, and the result looks like stained glass. ",

    "Abstract": "Many conference rooms are now equipped with multiple multi-media devices, such as plasma displays and surrounding speakers, to enhance presentation quality. However, most existing presentation authoring tools are based on the one-display-and-one-speaker assumption, which makes it difficult to organize and playback a presentation dispatched to multiple devices, thus hinders users from taking full advantage of additional multimedia devices. In this paper, we propose and implement a tool to facilitate authoring and playback of a multi-channel presentation in a media devices distributed environment. The tool, named PreAuthor, provides an intuitive and visual way to author a multi-channel presentation by dragging and dropping \"hyper-slides\" on corresponding visual representations of various devices. PreAuthor supports \"hyper-slide\" synchronization among various output devices during preview and playback. It also offers multiple options for the presenter to view the presentation in a rendered image sequence, live video, 3D VRML model, or real environment. ",

Such video lets users quickly access desired information without having to view the entire contents linearly. A challenge for presenting this type of video is to provide users with the appropriate affordances to understand the hypervideo structure and to navigate it effectively. Another challenge is to give authors tools that allow them to create good detail-on-demand video. Guided by user feedback, we iterated designs for a detail-on-demand video player. We also conducted two user studies to gain insight into people's understanding of hypervideo and to improve the user interface. We found that the interface design was tightly coupled to understanding hypervideo structure and that different designs greatly affected what parts of the video people accessed. The studies also suggested new guidelines for hypervideo authoring.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper we present recent developments in discourse theory and parsing under the Linguistic Discourse Model framework, a semantic theory of discourse structure. We give a novel approach to the problems of discourse segmentation based on discourse semantics and sketch a limited but robust approach to symbolic discourse parsing based on syntactic, semantic and lexical rules. To demonstrate the utilioty of the system in a real application, we briefly describe the architecture of the PALSUMM System, a symbolic smmarization system being developed at FX Palo Alto Laboratory that uses discourse structures constructed usding the theory otlined to summarize written English texts.",

    "Abstract": "This article describes two years of experience with a research prototype for personalizing shared workplace devices such as projectors, public displays, and multi-function copiers.  The system combines users' networked resources-or \"personal information clouds\"â€”with device-specific user interfaces for performing common device tasks. We developed and compared personal interfaces that are embedded (i.e., integrated or co-located with the shared device) and portable (i.e., accessible via personal devices such as mobile phones and PDAs). \r\n\r\nOur experience indicates that a little personalization can go a long way toward improving user friendliness, efficiency, and capabilities of shared document devices, helping them \"weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life\".  We also gained important insights into subtle differences between embedded and portable approaches to ubiquitous computing systems.",

Transparent layers are used to support browsing subtasks: keyword query, exploration of results through keyframes, and playback of video.  This layered interface smoothly blends the key tasks of the browsing process and deals with the small screen size.  During exploration, the user can adjust the transparency levels of the layers using pen gestures.  Details of the video segments are displayed in an expandable timeline that supports gestural interaction.",

    "Title": "Sharing Multimedia Content with Interactive Displays: A Case Study",
    "Abstract": "The Plasma Posters are large screen, digital, interactive posterboards designed for informal content sharing within teams, groups, organizations and communities. Leveraging the fact that the physical world is often used as a canvas for asynchronous information exchange via paper fliers and posters, the Plasma Posters provide a platform for sharing interactive digital content in public places. People serendipitously encounter multimedia content usually only encountered from the desktop, while going about their daily business. In this paper we describe the Plasma Poster interface in detail, and offer and overview of the underlying information authoring, parsing, storage, distribution and publishing infrastructure, the Plasma Poster Network. We report qualitative and quantitative data collected over 14 months of use that demonstrate the Plasma Posters have become an integral part of information sharing within our organization. We conclude the paper by reflecting on the patterns of adoption, and speculate on factors that have contributed to the system's success. Finally we briefly describe three other installations of the Plasma Poster Network and new interfaces that have been designed.",

Students receive instructorâ€™s slides on their PDAs as they are displayed by the instructor. As the individual members of the group take notes pertaining to the slide being presented, their notes are automatically sent to all members of the group. In addition, to reduce their typing, students can use text they receive from other students and from the instructors slides to construct their notes. This system has been used in actual practice for a graduate level course on wireless mobile computing. In developing this system, special attention has been paid to the task of inputting text on PDAs, efficient use of the screen real estate, dynamics among students, privacy and ease of use issues.",

    "Title": "Gooey Interfaces: An Approach for Rapidly Repurposing Digital Content",
    "Abstract": "With the acceleration of technological development we are reaching the point where our systems and their user interfaces become to some degree outdated 'legacy systems' as soon as they are released. This raises the question of how can we maintain, extend, override, and adapt these systems while preserving what people depend on in them? In this paper we describe an approach for dynamically restructuring user interfaces into a set of communicating processes that 1) provide methods for changing their appearance, behavior, and state; and 2) report their proposed state changes so that other processes may override their actions in updating themselves to a new state. We do this for both new and wrapped legacy user interface components, thereby allowing us to repurpose user interfaces for our evolving needs. We describe how this approach has been successfully used in rapidly creating and deploying interfaces that repurpose content for new appearances and behaviors. ",

In order to access details regarding contacts, users must typically shift their attention from tasks they are performing to the contact system itself in order to manually look-up contacts. This paper presents an approach for automatically retrieving contacts based on users' current context.  Results are presented to users in a manner that does not disrupt their tasks, but which allows them to access contact details with a single interaction. The approach promotes the discovery of new contacts that users may not have found otherwise and supports serendipity.",

Our work focuses on promoting community information sharing in public spaces using large screen, interactive, digital poster boards called the Plasma Posters. In this chapter we first describe our fieldwork-led, iterative design process, and elaborate a number of design guidelines that resulted. Following this, the design and development of the Plasma Posters themselves and the underlying network infrastructure is discussed. Finally, we present results from qualitative and quantitative evaluations over the course of a ten-month deployment of three Plasma Posters within our own organization, a software research community made up of technologists and designers. We conclude with observations regarding ergonomic, social and other factors that were raised during the design and deployment and offer  reflections on factors in the success of this deployment. ",

    "Title": "Shared Interactive Video for Teleconferencing",
    "Abstract": "We present a system that allows remote and local participants to control devices in a meeting environment using mouse or pen based gestures \"through\" video windows.  Unlike state-of-the-art device control interfaces that require interaction with text commands, buttons, or other artificial symbols, our approach allows users to interact with devices through live video of the environment.  This naturally extends our video supported pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) camera control system, by allowing gestures in video windows to control not only PTZ cameras, but also other devices visible in video images.  For example, an authorized meeting participant can show a presentation on a screen by dragging the file on a personal laptop and dropping it on the video image of the presentation screen. This paper presents the system architecture, implementation tradeoffs, and various meeting control scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "To simplify the process of editing interactive video, we developed the concept of \"detail-on-demand\" video as a subset of general hypervideo. Detail-on-demand video keeps the authoring and viewing interfaces relatively simple while supporting a wide range of interactive video applications. Our editor, Hyper-Hitchcock, provides a direct manipulation environment in which authors can combine video clips and place hyperlinks between them. To summarize a video, Hyper-Hitchcock can also automatically generate a hypervideo composed of multiple video summary levels and navigational links between these summaries and the original video. Viewers may interactively select the amount of detail they see, access more detailed summaries, and navigate to the source video through the summary. ",

Inspired by paper fliers on physical bulletin boards, posted content is displayed using 3D virtual fliers attached to a virtual corkboard by virtual pushpins. Fliers appear in different orientations, creating an attractive, informal look, and have autonomous behaviors like fluttering in the wind. Passers-by can rotate, move and fold fliers; they can also interact with fliers' live content. Flier content is streamed from a server and represented by the system on large screen displays using a real-time cloth simulation algorithm. We describe our prototype, and offer the results of an initial evaluative user study.",

Though these methods are applicable to general media, we concentrate here on characterizing repetitive structure in popular music. In the first step, a similarity matrix is calculated from inter-frame spectral similarity.  Segment boundaries, such as verse-chorus transitions, are found by correlating a kernel along the diagonal of the matrix. Once segmented, spectral statistics of each segment are computed. In the second step, segments are clustered based on the pairwise similarity of their statistics, using a matrix decomposition approach. Finally, the audio is summarized by combining segments representing\r\nthe clusters most frequently repeated throughout the piece. We present results on a small corpus showing more than 90% correct detection of verse and chorus segments.",

Communication used to be viewed as a technical problem of separating signal from noise and managing bandwidth. Now it is a social matter in which negotiating differences in understanding among communicators is a primary business priority. Addressing this priority requires an understanding of how individuals interact in the course of their decision making activities. Using the work of Anthony Giddens as a point of departure, this paper views interaction in communication as consisting of three dimensions - meaning, authority, and trust. These three dimensions are used to identify new opportunities for advances in decision making technology that help deal with potential breakdowns in social interaction.",

Moreover, this system allows remote viewers to control their own virtual cameras instead of watching the same video produced by a human operator or a fully automatic system.

We\r\nvalidate the analysis on real human genes by comparing coexpressed pairs\r\nto GO annotations and find that LNP is more sensitive than three previous\r\nmethods. We also find a small but statistically significant level of\r\ncoexpression between interacting proteins relative to randomized\r\ncontrols.

    "Abstract": "Hypervideo is a form of interactive video that allows users to follow links to other video. A simple form of hypervideo,\r\ncalled \"detail-on-demand video,\" provides at most one link from one segment of video to another, supporting a singlebutton\r\ninteraction. Detail-on-demand video is well suited for interactive video summaries, because the user can request a\r\nmore detailed summary while watching the video. Users interact with the video is through a special hypervideo player\r\nthat displays keyframes with labels indicating when a link is available. While detail-on-demand summaries can be\r\nmanually authored, it is a time-consuming task. To address this issue, we developed an algorithm to automatically\r\ngenerate multi-level hypervideo summaries. The highest level of the summary consists of the most important clip from\r\neach take or scene in the video. At each subsequent level, more clips from each take or scene are added in order of their\r\nimportance. We give one example in which a hypervideo summary is created for a linear training video. We also show\r\nhow the algorithm can be modified to produce a hypervideo summary for home video.",

Our application automatically divides photos into meaningful events such as birthdays or trips. Several user interaction mechanisms enhance the user experience when organizing photos. Our application combines a light table for showing thumbnails of the entire photo collection with a tree view that supports navigating, sorting, and filtering photos by categories such as dates, events, people, and locations. A calendar view visualizes photos over time and allows for the quick assignment of dates to scanned photos. We fine-tuned our application by using it with large personal photo collections provided by several users.",

    "Abstract": "To simplify the process of editing interactive video, we developed the concept of \"detail-on-demand\" video as a subset of general hypervideo where a single button press reveals additional information about the current video sequence. Detail-on-demand video keeps the authoring and viewing interfaces relatively simple while supporting a wide range of interactive video applications. Our editor, Hyper-Hitchcock, builds on prior work on automatic analysis to find the best quality video clips. It introduces video composites as an abstraction for grouping and manipulating sets of video clips. Navigational links can be created between any two video clips or composites. Such links offer a variety of return behaviors for when the linked video is completed that can be tailored to different materials. Initial impressions from a pilot study indicate that Hyper-Hitchcock is easy to learn although the behavior of links is not immediately intuitive for all users.",

For the public displays, we present the ModSlideShow system with a discrete modular model for linking the displays into groups, along with a gestural interface for manipulating the flow of slides within a display group. For the applications on personal devices, an augmented reality widget with panoramic video supports interaction among the various displays.

    "Abstract": "Existing hypertext systems have emphasized either the navigational or spatial expression of relationships between objects. We are exploring the combination of these modes of expression in Hyper-Hitchcock, a hypervideo editor. Hyper-Hitchcock supports a form of hypervideo called \"detail-on-demand video\" due to its applicability to situations where viewers need to take a link to view more details on the content currently being presented. Authors of detail-on-demand video select, group, and spatially arrange video clips into linear sequences in a two-dimensional workspace. Hyper-Hitchcock uses a simple spatial parser to determine the temporal order of selected video clips. Authors add navigational links between the elements in those sequences. This combination of navigational and spatial hypertext modes of expression separates the clip sequence from the navigational structure of the hypervideo. Such a combination can be useful in cases where multiple forms of inter-object relationships must be expressed on the same content.",

If we\r\nunderstand the relationship between the types of marks on a passage and the passage's\r\nultimate utility in a task, then we can design e-book software to facilitate\r\naccess to the most important annotated parts of the documents. To investigate\r\nthis hypothesis and to guide software design, we have analyzed annotations collected\r\nduring an earlier study of law students reading printed case law and\r\nwriting Moot Court briefs. This study has allowed us to characterize the relationship\r\nbetween the students' annotations and the citations they use in their final\r\nwritten briefs. We think of annotations that relate directly to the written brief as\r\nhigh-value annotations; these annotations have particular, detectable characteristics.\r\nBased on this study we have designed a mark parser that analyzes freeform\r\ndigital ink to identify such high-value annotations.",

We structure such summaries as \"detail-on-demand\" video, a subset of general hypervideo in which at most one link to another video sequence is available at any given time. Our editor for such video, Hyper-Hitchcock, provides a workspace in which an author can select and arrange video clips, generate composites from clips and from other composites, and place links between composites. To simplify dealing with a large number of clips, Hyper-Hitchcock generates iconic representations for composites that can be used to manipulate the composite as a whole. In addition to providing an authoring environment, Hyper-Hitchcock can automatically generate multi-level hypervideo summaries for immediate use or as the starting point for author modification. ",

The summaries are comprised of images from the video that are sized according to their importance. The algorithm performs a global optimization with respect to a layout cost function that encompasses features such as the number of resized images and the amount of whitespace in the presentation. The algorithm creates summaries that: always fit exactly into the requested area, are varied by containing few rows with images of the same size, and have little whitespace at the end of the last row. The layout algorithm is fast enough to allow the interactive resizing of the summaries and the subsequent generation of a new layout.",

The sequence, duration, and degree of the time-scale modifications are the parameters which encode information in the altered signal. By comparing the altered signal with a reference copy, compressed and expanded regions can be identified and the hidden data recovered. This approach is novel and has several advantages over other methods: it is theoretically noiseless, it introduces no spectral distortion, and it is robust to all known methods of reproduction, compression, and transmission.",

    "Abstract": "A basic objective of ubiquitous computing research is ubiquitous information: the ability to utilize any content or service, using devices that are always at hand, over networks that don't tie us down. Although much progress has been made, the ideal remains elusive. This paper reflects on the interrelations among three dimensions of ubiquitous information: content, devices, and networks. We use our understanding of these dimensions to motivate our own attempt to create a ubiquitous information system by combining unlimited World Wide Web content with mobile phones and mobile phone networks. We briefly describe a middleware proxy system we developed to increase the usefulness of very small devices as Internet terminals. We conclude with a post-mortem analysis highlighting lessons learned for others interested in information systems for very small devices. ",

Because these devices don't know who we are, they provide the same user interface and functionality to everyone. This paper describes a system for personalizing workplace document devices- projectors, public displays, and multi-function copiers-that has been in use for over two years in our organization. We compare user interfaces that are embedded (i.e., integrated or co-located with the shared device) versus portable (i.e., accessible via portable devices such as mobile phones or PDAs). We summarize lessons learned for others designing interfaces for shared ubiquitous devices.",

    "Title": "Interaction management:  the next (and necessary) step beyond knowledge management",
    "Abstract": "Purveyors of knowledge management software have a disconcerting tendency to promote the myth that all problems may be solved by more powerful tools for the exchange of information in the workplace.  This fallacy is based on the faulty assumption that knowledge management is about the management of knowledge (as if knowledge were a commodity that could be managed), as opposed to the management of people whose work depends critically on what they know.  The origins of knowledge management are far more firmly rooted in the psychological legacy of organizational communication than they are in the technological legacy of information management systems.  However, even organizational communication is an inadequate foundation, since various schools of thought in social theory, particularly the structuration theory of Anthony Giddens, inform us that interaction (in the workplace or in any other social setting) is not strictly limited to communication.  Knowledge management thus requires moving beyond simplistic models of information exchange to more challenging problems of leveraging social interaction to the advantage of the enterprise.  This paper focuses on the claim of structuration theory that the dimension of communication should be supplemented with additional dimensions of power and sanction.  This perspective is then examined in light of a case study of crisis management practices, and the case study provides a basis for addressing implications for technological support.",

Our approach is to maximize the average similarity between the excerpt and the\r\nsource. We first calculate a similarity matrix by comparing each pair of time samples using a quantitative similarity measure. To determine the segment with highest average similarity, we maximize the summation of the self-similarity matrix over the support of the segment. To select multiple excerpts while avoiding redundancy, we compute the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) of the similarity matrix into its essential structural components. We then build a summary comprised of excerpts from the main components, selecting the excerpts for maximum average similarity within each component. Variations integrating segmentation and other information are also discussed, and experimental results are presented.",

The control system integrates requests from multiple users with the result that each controls a virtual camera. The control system seamlessly integrates manual and fully automatic control. It supports a range of options from untended automatic to full manual control, and the system can learn control strategies from user requests. Additionally, the panoramic view is always available for an intuitive interface, and objects are never out of view regardless of the zoom factor. We present the system architecture, an information-theoretic approach to combining panoramic and zoomed images to optimally satisfy user requests, and experimental results that show the FlySPEC system significantly assists users in a remote inspection tasks.

    "Abstract": "We present methods for automatic and semi-automatic creation of music videos, given an arbitrary audio soundtrack and source video. Significant audio changes are automatically detected; similarly, the source video is automatically segmented and analyzed for suitability based on camera motion and exposure. Video with excessive camera motion or poor contrast is penalized with a high unsuitability score, and is more likely to be discarded in the final edit. High quality video clips are then automatically selected and aligned in time with significant audio changes. Video clips are adjusted to match the audio segments by selecting the most suitable region of the desired length. Besides a fully automated solution, our system can also start with clips manually selected and ordered using a graphical interface. The video is then created by truncating the selected clips (preserving the high quality portions) to produce a video digest that is synchronized with the soundtrack music, thus enhancing the impact of both.

To find the most representative excerpt, we maximize the average segment similarity to the entire work. After window-based audio parameterization, a quantitative similarity measure is calculated between every pair of windows, and the results\r\nare embedded in a 2-D similarity matrix. Summing the similarity matrix over the support of a segment results in a measure of how similar that segment is to the whole. This measure is maximized to find the segment that best represents the entire work. We discuss variations on the method, and present experimental results for orchestral music, popular songs, and jazz. These results demonstrate that the method finds significantly representative excerpts, using very few assumptions about the source audio.",

    "Abstract": "Evaluating ubiquitous systems is hard, and has attracted the attention of others in the research community. These investigators, like others in CSCW, argue there is a basic mismatch between traditional evaluation techniques and the needs posed by ubiquitous systems. Namely, these systems are embedded in a variety of complex real world environments that cannot be easily modeled (as required by theoretical analyses), simulated, measured, or controlled (as required by laboratory experiments). As a result, many investigators have abandoned traditional comparative evaluation techniques and opted instead for techniques adapted from the social sciences, such as anthropology. We wanted to perform a comparative evaluation similar to a laboratory experiment, but in such a way that we could observe the effects of our design decisions in relatively unconstrained, real world use. This led us to the process described in this paper.",

The TactGuide is operated by tactile inspection which is subtle enough to allow the users to engage/disengage in device interaction while preserving their visual, auditory and kinesthetic senses for inspection of the environment. The TactGuide design thereby accommodates the users' need to economize their attentional resources between device and environment while navigating through physical space. Preliminary experiments indicates that users readily map the tactile cues to spatial directions and that TactGuide can be operated as a supplement to, and without compromising, the use of our existing wayfinding abilities. substituting the use of our natural abilities and earned skills for wayfinding.

    "Abstract": "To implement any quantum operation (a.k.a. ``superoperator'' or ``CP map'') on a d-dimensional quantum system, it is\r\n     enough to apply a suitable overall unitary transformation to the system and a d^2-dimensional environment which is\r\n     initialized in a fixed pure state. It has been suggested that a d-dimensional environment might be enough if we could\r\n     initialize the environment in a mixed state of our choosing. In this note we show with elementary means that certain\r\n     explicit quantum operations cannot be realized in this way. Our counterexamples map some pure states to pure states,\r\n     giving strong and easily manageable conditions on the overall unitary transformation. Everything works in the more\r\n     general setting of quantum operations from d-dimensional to d'-dimensional spaces, so we place our counterexamples\r\n     within this more general framework. ",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a camera system called FlySPEC.  In contrast to a traditional camera system that provides the same video stream to every user, FlySPEC can simultaneously serve different video-viewing requests.  This flexibility allows users to conveniently participate in a seminar or meeting at their own pace.  Meanwhile, the FlySPEC system provides a seamless blend of manual control and automation.  With this control mix, users can easily make tradeoffs between video capture effort and video quality.  The FlySPEC camera is constructed by installing a set of Pan/Tilt/Zoom (PTZ) cameras near a high-resolution panoramic camera.  While the panoramic camera provides the basic functionality of serving different viewing requests, the PTZ camera is managed by our algorithm to improve the overall video quality that may affect users watching details.  The video resolution improvements from using different camera management strategies are compared in the experimental section.",

This allows \"virtual tours\" to be synthesized by splicing the panoramic video at the intersection points. Spatial intersections are detected by finding the best-matching panoramic images from a number of nearby candidates. Each panoramic image is segmented into horizontal strips. Each strip is averaged in the vertical direction. The Fourier coefficients of the resulting 1-D data capture the rotation-invariant horizontal texture of each panoramic image. The distance between two panoramic images is calculated as the sum of the distances between their strip texture pairs at the same row positions. The intersection is chosen as the two candidate panoramic images that have the minimum distance.\r\n",

    "Abstract": "We present a framework, motivated by rate-distortion theory and the human visual system, for optimally representing the real world given limited video resolution. To provide users with high fidelity views, we built a hybrid video camera system that combines a fixed wide-field panoramic camera with a controllable pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) camera. In our framework, a video frame is viewed as a limited-frequency representation of some \"true\" image function.  Our system combines outputs from both cameras to construct the highest fidelity views possible, and controls the PTZ camera to maximize information gain available from higher spatial frequencies.  In operation, each remote viewer is presented with a small panoramic view of the entire scene, and a larger close-up view of a selected region. Users may select a region by marking the panoramic view.  The system operates the PTZ camera to best satisfy requests from multiple users. When no regions are selected, the system automatically operates the PTZ camera to minimize predicted video distortion. High-resolution images are cached and sent if a previously recorded region has not changed and the PTZ camera is pointed elsewhere. We present experiments demonstrating that the panoramic image can effectively predict where to gain the most information, and also that the system provides better images to multiple users than conventional camera systems.",

Communication is no longer just a technical matter of separating signal from noise and managing bandwidth but also a social matter in which negotiating differences in understanding among and between communicators is a primary business priority. Addressing this priority requires an understanding of how individuals interact in the course of their decision making activities. Using the work of Anthony Giddens as a point of departure, this paper views interaction in communication as consisting of three dimensions - meaning, authority, and trust. These three dimensions are used to identify new opportunities for advances in decision making technology which help deal with potential breakdowns in social interaction.",

    "Abstract": "A basic objective of Weiser's Ubiquitous Computing vision is ubiquitous information access:  being able to utilize any content or service (e.g., all the rich media content and services on the WWW), using devices that are always \"at hand\" (embedded in environments or portable), over a network with universal coverage and adequate bandwidth. Although much progress has been made, the ideal remains elusive.  This paper examines the inter-relations among three dimensions of ubiquitous information systems: (1) ubiquitous content; (2) ubiquitous devices; and (3) ubiquitous networking. We use the space defined by these dimensions to reflect on the tradeoffs designers make and to chart some past and current information systems. Given this background, we present m-Links (mobile links), a new system that takes aim at the elusive ideal of ubiquitous information. Our approach builds on wireless web phone technologies because of their trend towards ubiquitous devices and networking (the second and third dimensions). Yet such very small devices sacrifice usability as rich media Internet terminals (the first dimension). To offset this limitation, we propose a new information access model for very small devices that supports a much wider range of content and services than previously possible. We have built this system with an emphasis on open systems extensibility and describe its design and implementation.",

    "Title": "Content Standards for Electronic Books: The OEBF Publication Structure and the Role of the Public Interest",
    "Abstract": "In the emerging world of electronic publishing how we create, distribute, and read books will be in a large part determined by an underlying framework of content standards that establishes the range of technological opportunities and constraints for publishing and reading systems. But efforts to develop content standards based on sound engineering models must skillfully negotiate competing and sometimes apparently irreconcilable objectives if they are to produce results relevant to the rapidly changing course of technology. The Open eBook Forum's Publication Structure, an XML-based specification for electronic books, is an example of the sort of timely and innovative problem solving required for successful real-world standards development. As a result of this effort, the electronic book industry will not only happen sooner and on a larger scale than it would have otherwise, but the electronic books it produces will be more functional, more interoperable, and more accessible to all readers. Public interest participants have a critical role in this process.",

The research objective was to explore how such a system would improve\r\ncommunication and facilitate a shared understanding among distributed development groups. During the deployment of our Portholes\r\nsystem, we conducted a naturalistic study by soliciting user feedback and evolving the system in response. Many of the initial reactions of\r\npotential users indicated that our system projected the wrong image so that we designed a new version that provided explicit cues about\r\nbeing in public and who is looking back to suggest a social rather than information interface. We implemented the new design as a Java\r\napplet and evaluated design choices with a preference study. Our experiences with different Portholes versions and user reactions to them\r\nprovide insights for designing awareness tools beyond Portholes systems. Our approach is for the studies to guide and to provide feedback\r\nfor the design and technical development of our system.",

We then develop an efficient subspace representation for the object radiance indexed on the surface of the three dimensional object tem-plate.  We integrate the low-dimensional representation for\r\n\r\nthe object radiance, or signature, into the pattern-theoretic template, and present the results of orientation estimation experiments. The experiments demonstrate both estimation performance fluctuations under varying illumination conditions and performance degradations associated with unknown scene illumination. We also present a Bayesian approach for estimation accommodating illumination variability.",

    "Abstract": "Recent years have seen a marked increase in the production and promotion of portable,\r\nwireless communication devices: mobile phones with internet access, wireless PDAs\r\nsuch as the Palm VII and smart pagers such as RIM's 850 and 950. Some claim the\r\npresence of such devices in the hands, bags and pockets of so many people heralds a new\r\nworld of work in which people can be reached and information accessed \"anywhere,\r\nanytime\". Whether or not access to information in itself can promote new working\r\npractices, individuals whose lives revolve around movement between work sites have\r\nbeen singled out as an obvious market for such portable wireless communication devices.\r\nUsing these devices such â€œmobile workersâ€ can be in touch with colleagues, collaborators\r\nand clients \"24/7\", and still sustain non-work social relationships due, apparently, to their\r\nconstant connectedness whilst mobile.\r\nIn this chapter we have two goals. The first is to address the design of mobile\r\ntechnologies. This second is to illustrate our design approach, wherein we consider local\r\npractices of technology use, but also the broader cultural context in which technologies\r\nare designed, produced, bought, sold, used and redesigned. Our ultimate design aim is to\r\nbuild upon existing practices, but also to consider possibilities for the development of\r\ninnovative technologies that enable new, complementary, practices.",

The approach is flexible to the choice of similarity measure and is robust and data-independent because the data is used to model itself.

In this paper we investigate a novel use for a wireless network based on the IEEE 802.11 standard: inferring the location of a wireless client from signal quality measures. Similar work has been limited to prototype systems that rely on nearest-neighbor techniques to\r\ninfer location. In this paper, we describe Nibble, a Wi-Fi location service that\r\nuses Bayesian networks to infer the location of a device. We explain the general\r\ntheory behind the system and how to use the system, along with describing our\r\nexperiences at a university campus building and at a research lab. We also\r\ndiscuss how probabilistic modeling can be applied to a diverse range of\r\napplications that use sensor data.",

Panoramic video is captured by moving a 360Â° camera along continuous paths. Users can interactively replay the video with the ability to view any interesting object or choose a particular direction. Spatially indexed video gives the ability to travel along paths or roads with a map-like interface. At junctions, or intersection points, users can chose which path to follow as well as which direction to look, allowing interaction not available with conventional video. Combining the spatial index with a spatial database of maps or objects allows users to navigate to specific locations or interactively inspect particular objects.  ",

The acoustic similarity between any two instants of an audio recording is displayed in a static 2D representation, which makes structural and rhythmic characteristics visible. Unlike practically all prior work, this method characterizes self-similarity rather than specific audio attributes such as pitch or spectral features. Examples are presented for classical and popular music. \r\n\r\n",

The proposed method is based on the FlyCam system, which produces high resolution and wide-angle\r\nvideo sequences by stitching the video frames from multiple\r\nstationary cameras. The method integrates tracking and\r\nrecording processes, and targets applications such as classroom lectures and video conferencing. First, the region of interest (which typically covers the speaker) is tracked using a Kalman filter. Then, the Kalman filter estimation results are used for virtual camera control and to record the video. The system has no physical camera motion and the virtual camera parameters are readily available for video indexing. The proposed system has been implemented for real time recording of lectures and presentations.",

    "Abstract": "To meet the diverse needs of business, education, and personal video users, the authors developed three visual interfaces that help identify potentially useful or relevant video segments. In such interfaces, keyframes-still images automatically extracted from video footage-can distinguish videos, summarize them, and provide access points. Well-chosen keyframes enhance a listing's visual appeal and help users select videos. Keyframe selection can vary depending on the application's requirements: A visual summary of a video-captured meeting may require only a few highlight keyframes, a video editing system might need a keyframe for every clip, while a browsing interface requires an even distribution of keyframes over the video's full length. The authors conducted user studies for each of their three interfaces, gathering input for subsequent interface improvements. The studies revealed that finding a similarity measure for collecting video clips into groups that more closely match human perception poses a challenge. Another challenge is to further improve the video-segmentation algorithm used for selecting keyframes. A new version will provide users with more information and control without sacrificing the interface's ease of use. \r\n",

    "Abstract": "We introduce the beat spectrum, a new method of automatically characterizing the rhythm and tempo of music and audio. The beat spectrum is a measure of acoustic self-similarity as a function of time lag. Highly structured or repetitive music will have strong beat spectrum peaks at the repetition times. This reveals both tempo and the relative strength of particular beats, and therefore can distinguish between different kinds of rhythms at the same tempo. We also introduce the beat spectrogram which graphically illustrates rhythm variation over time. Unlike previous approaches to tempo analysis, the beat spectrum does not depend on particular attributes such as energy or frequency, and thus will work for any music or audio in any genre. We present tempo estimation results for a variety of musical genres, which are accurate to within 1%. This approach has a variety of applications, including music retrieval by similarity and automatically  generating music videos.",

    "Title": "The impact of text browsing on text retrieval performance.",
    "Abstract": "The results from a series of three experiments that used Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) data and TREC search topics are compared. These experiments each involved three novel user interfaces (one per experiment). User interfaces that made it easier for users to view text were found to improve recall in all three experiments. A distinction was found between a cluster of subjects (a majority of whom were search experts) who tended to read fewer documents more carefully (readers, or exclusives) and subjects who skimmed through more documents without reading them as carefully (skimmers, or inclusives). Skimmers were found to have significantly better recall overall. A major outcome from our experiments at TREC and with the TREC data, is that hypertext interfaces to information retrieval (IR) tasks tend to increase recall. Our interpretation of this pattern of results across the three experiments is that increased interaction with the text (more pages viewed) generally improves recall. Findings from one of the experiments indicated that viewing a greater diversity of text on a single screen (i.e., not just more text per se, but more articles available at once) may also improve recall. In an experiment where a traditional (type-in) query interface was contrasted with a condition where queries were marked up on the text, the improvement in recall due to viewing more text was more pronounced with search novices. Our results demonstrate that markup and hypertext interfaces to text retrieval systems can benefit recall and can also benefit novices. The challenge now will be to find modified versions of hypertext interfaces that can improve precision, as well as recall and that can work with users who prefer to use different types of search strategy or have different types of training and experience.",

Very small devices, typically with 3-20 lines of text, provide portability and other functionality while sacrificing usability as Internet terminals. In order to provide access on such limited hardware we propose a small device web navigation model that is more appropriate than the desktop computers web browsing model. We introduce a middleware proxy, the Navigation Engine, to facilitate the navigation model by concisely displaying the Webs link (i.e., URL) structure. Because not all Web information is appropriately \"linked,\" the Navigation Engine incorporates data-detectors to extract bits of useful information such as phone numbers and addresses. In order to maximize program-data composibility, multiple network-based services (similar to browser plug-ins) are keyed to a links attributes such as its MIME type. We have built this system with an emphasis on user extensibility and we describe the design and implementation as well as a basic set of middleware services that we have found to be particularly important.",

    "Abstract": "Hitchcock is a system to simplify the process of editing video. Its key features are the use of automatic analysis to find the best quality video clips, an algorithm to cluster those clips into meaningful piles, and an intuitive user interface for combining the desired clips into a final video. We conducted a user study to determine how the automatic clip creation and pile navigation support users in the editing process. The study showed that users liked the ease-of-use afforded by automation, but occasionally had problems navigating and overriding the automated editing decisions. These findings demonstrate the need for a proper balance between automation and user control. Thus, we built a new version of Hitchcock that retains the automatic editing features, but provides additional controls for navigation and for allowing users to modify the system decisions.",

    "Abstract": "The two most commonly used techniques for evaluating the fit between application design and use - namely, usability testing and beta testing with user feedback - suffer from a number of limitations that restrict evaluation scale (in the case of usability tests) and data quality (in the case of beta tests). They also fail to provide developers with an adequate basis for: (1) assessing the impact of suspected problems on users at large, and (2) deciding where to focus development and evaluation resources to maximize the benefit for users at large. This paper describes an agent-based approach for collecting usage data and user feedback over the Internet that addresses these limitations to provide developers with a complementary source of usage- and usability-related information.  Contributions include: a theory to motivate and guide data collection, an architecture capable of supporting very large scale data collection, and real-word experience suggesting the proposed approach is complementary to existing practice.",

We first characterize a work setting in which we expected an e-book to be a useful interface for reading and otherwise using a mix of physical and digital library materials, and explore what kinds of reading-related functionality would bring value to this setting. We do this by describing important aspects of legal research in a heterogeneous information environment, including mobility, reading, annotation, link following and writing practices, and their general implications for design. We then discuss how our work with a user community and an evolving e-book prototype allowed us to examine tandem issues of usability and utility, and to redesign an existing e-book user interface to suit the needs of law students. The study caused us to move away from the notion of a stand-alone reading device and toward the concept of a document laptop, a platform that would provide wireless access to information resources, as well as support a fuller spectrum of reading-related activities.",

    "Abstract": "The Internet provides a highly suitable infrastructure for sharing multimedia meeting records, especially as multimedia technologies become more lightweight and workers more mobile. LiteMinutes is a system that uses both the Web and email for creating, revising, distributing, and accessing multimedia information captured in a meeting. Supported media include text notes taken on wireless laptops, slide images captured from presentations, and video recorded by cameras in the room. At the end of a meeting, text notes are sent by the note taking applet to the server, which formats them in HTML with links from each note item to the captured slide images and video recording. Smart link generation is achieved by capturing contextual metadata such as the on/off state of the media equipment and the room location of the laptop, and inferring whether it makes sense to supply media links to a particular note item. Note takers can easily revise meeting minutes after a meeting by modifying the email message sent to them and mailing it back to the server’s email address. We explore design issues concerning preferences for email and Web access of meeting minutes, as well as the different timeframes for access. We also describe the integration with a comic book style video summary and visualization system with text captions for browsing the video recording of a meeting.",

Digitally combining images from an array of inexpensive video cameras results in a wide-field panoramic camera, from inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware. This system can aid distance learning in several ways, by both presenting a better view of the instructor and teaching materials to the students, and by enabling better audience feedback to the instructor. Because the camera is fixed with respect to the background, simple motion analysis can be used to track objects and people of interest. Electronically selecting a region of this results in a rapidly steerable \"virtual camera.\" We present system details and a prototype distance-learning scenario using multiple panoramic cameras.",

    "Abstract": "While hypertext was originally conceived for the management of scientific and technical information, it has been embraced with great enthusiasm by several members of the literary community for the promises it offers towards new approaches to narrative.  Experiments with hypertext-based interactive narrative were originally based solely on verbal text but have more recently extended to include digital video artifacts.  The most accomplished of these experiments, HyperCafe, provided new insights into the nature of narrative and how it may be presented;  but it also offered an opportunity to reconsider other text types.  This paper is an investigation of the application of an approach similar to HyperCafe to a descriptive text.  We discuss how the approach serves the needs of description and illustrate the discussion with a concrete example.  We then conclude by considering the extent to which our experiences with description may be applied to our continuing interest in narrative.",

    "Title": "Extracting usability information from user interface events",
    "Abstract": "Modern window-based user interface systems generate user interface events as natural products of their normal operation. Because such events can be automatically captured and because they indicate user behavior with respect to an application's user interface, they have long been regarded as a potentially fruitful source of information regarding application usage and usability. However, because user interface events are typically voluminos and rich in detail, automated support is generally required to extract information at a level of abstraction that is useful to investigators interested in analyzing application usage or evaluating usability. This survey examines computer-aided techniques used by HCI practitioners and researchers to extract usability-related information from user interface events. A framework is presented to help HCI practitioners and researchers categorize and compare the approaches that have been, or might fruitfully be, applied to this problem. Because many of the techniques in the research literature have not been evaluated in practice, this survey provides a conceptual evaluation to help identify some of the relative merits and drawbacks of the various classes of approaches. Ideas for future research in this area are also presented. This survey addresses the following questions: How might user interface events be used in evaluating usability? How are user interface events related to other forms of usability data? What are the key challenges faced by investigators wishing to exploit this data? What approaches have been brought to bear on this problem and how do they compare to one another? What are some of the important open research questions in this area? ",

    "Title": "A Multi-Channel Infrastructure for Presenting Nonlinear Hypermedia",
    "Abstract": "While hypermedia is usually presented as a way to offer content in a nonlinear manner, hypermedia structure tends to reinforce the assumption that reading is basically a linear process.  Link structures provide a means by which the reader may choose different paths to traverse;  but each of these paths is fundamentally linear, revealed through either a block of text or a well-defined chain of links.  While there are experiences that get beyond such linear constraints, such as driving a car, it is very hard to capture this kind of non-linearity, characterized by multiple sources of stimuli competing for attention, in a hypermedia document.  This paper presents a multi-channel document infrastructure that provides a means by which all such sources of attention are presented on a single \"page\" (i.e., a display with which the reader interacts) and move between background and foreground in response to the activities of the reader.  The infrastructure thus controls the presentation of content with respect to four dimensions:   visual, audio, interaction support, and rhythm.",

    "Abstract": "Hitchcock is a system that allows users to easily create custom videos from raw video shot with a standard video camera. In contrast to other video editing systems, Hitchcock uses automatic analysis to determine the suitability of portions of the raw video. Unsuitable video typically has fast or erratic camera motion. Hitchcock first analyzes video to identify the type and amount of camera motion: fast pan, slow zoom, etc. Based on this analysis, a numerical \"unsuitability\" score is computed for each frame of the video. Combined with standard editing rules, this score is used to identify clips for inclusion in the final video and to select their start and end points. To create a custom video, the user drags keyframes corresponding to the desired clips into a storyboard. Users can lengthen or shorten the clip without specifying the start and end frames explicitly. Clip lengths are balanced automatically using a spring-based algorithm.",

Unlike many other approaches, this system is based on analysis of the audio waveform and does not rely on symbolic or MIDI representations. ARTHUR retrieves audio on the basis of long-term structure, specifically the variation of soft and louder passages. The long-term structure is determined from envelope of audio energy versus time in one or more frequency bands. Similarity between energy profiles is calculated using dynamic programming. Given an example audio document, other documents in a collection can be ranked by similarity of their energy profiles. Experiments are presented for a modest corpus that demonstrate excellent results in retrieving different performances of the same orchestral work, given an example performance or short excerpt as a query.

    "Title": "An Introduction to Quantum Computing for Non-Physicists.",
    "Abstract": "Richard Feynman's observation that quantum mechanical effects could not be simulated efficiently on a computer led to speculation that computation in general could be done more efficiently if it used quantum effects. This speculation appeared justified when Peter Shor described a polynomial time quantum algorithm for factoring integers. In quantum systems, the computational space increases exponentially with the size of the system which enables exponential parallelism. This parallelism could lead to exponentially faster quantum algorithms than possible classically. The catch is that accessing the results, which requires measurement, proves tricky and requires new non-traditional programming techniques. The aim of this paper is to guide computer scientists and other non-physicists through the conceptual and notational barriers that separate quantum computing from conventional computing. We introduce basic principles of quantum mechanics to explain where the power of quantum computers comes from and why it is difficult to harness. We describe quantum cryptography, teleportation, and dense coding. Various approaches to harnessing the power of quantum parallelism are explained, including Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm, and Hogg's algorithms. We conclude with a discussion of quantum error correction. ",

This paper describes a novel technique for determining keyframes that are different from each other and provide a good representation of the whole video. We use keyframes to distinguish videos from each other, to summarize videos, and to provide access points into them. The technique can determine any number of keyframes by clustering the frames in a video and by selecting a representative frame from each cluster. Temporal constraints are used to filter out some clusters and to determine the representative frame for a cluster. Desirable visual features can be emphasized in the set of keyframes. An application for browsing a collection of videos makes use of the keyframes to support skimming and to provide visual summaries.",

    "Abstract": "Much of hypertext narrative relies on links to shape a reader's interaction with the text. But links may be too limited to express ambiguity, imprecision, and entropy, or to admit new modes of participation short of full collaboration. We use an e-book form to explore the implications of freeform annotation-based interaction with hypertext narrative. Readers' marks on the text can be used to guide navigation, create a persistent record of a reading, or to recombine textual elements as a means of creating a new narrative. In this paper, we describe how such an experimental capability was created on top of XLibris, a next generation e-book, using Forward Anywhere as the hypernarrative. We work through a scenario of interaction, and discuss the issues the work raises",

    "Abstract": "We present and interactive system that allows a user to locate regions of video that are similar to a video query. Thus segments of video can be found by simply providing an example of the video of interest. The user selects a video segment for the query from either a static frame-based interface or a video player. A statistical model of the query is calculated on-the-fly, and is used to find similar regions of video. The similarity measure is based on a Gaussian model of reduced frame image transform coefficients. Similarity in a single video is displayed in the Metadata Media Player. The player can be used to navigate through the video by jumping between regions of similarity. Similarity can be rapidly calculated for multiple video files as well. These results are displayed in MBase, a Web-based video browser that allows similarity in multiple video files to be visualized simultaneously. ",

    "Abstract": "This paper describes an application-independent tool called Anchored Conversations that brings together text-based conversations and documents. The design of Anchored Conversations is based on our observations of the use of documents and text chats in collaborative settings. We observed that chat spaces support work conversations, but they do not allow the close integration of conversations with work documents that can be seen when people are working together face-to-face. Anchored Conversations directly addresses this problem by allowing text chats to be anchored into documents. Anchored Conversations also facilitates document sharing; accepting an invitation to an anchored conversation results in the document being automatically uploaded. In addition, Anchored Conversations provides support for review, catch-up and asynchronous communications through a database. In this paper we describe motivating fieldwork, the design of Anchored Conversations, a scenario of use, and some preliminary results from a user study. ",

We developed a novel approach for selecting still images from a video suitable for summarizing the video and for providing entry points into it. Images are laid out in a compact, visually pleasing display reminiscent of a comic book or Japanese manga. Users can explore the video by interacting with the presented summary. Links from each keyframe start video playback and/or present additional detail. Captions can be added to presentation frames to include commentary or descriptions such as the minutes of a recorded meeting. We conducted a study to compare variants of our summarization technique. The study participants judged the manga summary to be significantly better than the other two conditions with respect to their suitability for summaries and navigation, and their visual appeal. ",

    "Title": "It's all in the words: Supporting work activities with lightweight tools.",
    "Abstract": "The development of tools to support synchronous communications between non-collocated colleagues has received considerable attention in recent years. Much of the work has focused on increasing a sense of co-presence between interlocutors by supporting aspects of face-to-face conversations that go beyond mere words (e.g. gaze, postural shifts). In this regard, a design goal for many environments is the provision of as much media-richness as possible to support non-collocated communication. In this paper we present results from our most recent interviews studying the use of a text-based virtual environment to support work collaborations. We describe how such an environment, though lacking almost all the visual and auditory cues known to be important in face-to-face conversation, has played an important role in day-to-day communication. We offer a set of characteristics we feel are important to the success of this text-only tool and discuss issues emerging from its long-term use. \r\n",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents methods for automatically\r\ncreating pictorial video summaries that resemble\r\ncomic books. The relative importance of\r\nvideo segments is computed from their length\r\nand novelty. Image and audio analysis is used\r\nto automatically detect and emphasize meaningful\r\nevents. Based on this importance measure,\r\nwe choose relevant keyframes. Selected\r\nkeyframes are sized by importance, and then\r\nefficiently packed into a pictorial summary.\r\nWe present a quantitative measure of how well\r\na summary captures the salient events in a\r\nvideo, and show how it can be used to improve\r\nour summaries. The result is a compact and\r\nvisually pleasing summary that captures\r\nsemantically important events, and is suitable\r\nfor printing or Web access. Such a summary\r\ncan be further enhanced by including text captions\r\nderived from OCR or other methods. We\r\ndescribe how the automatically generated summaries\r\nare used to simplify access to a large\r\ncollection of videos.",

Two redesigns of the Portholes display present a 3D theater view of the audience. Different sections display core team members, non-core team members and lookback. An experiment determined that people have strong preferences about audience information and how it should be displayed. Layout preferences are varied, but unfolding techniques and cluster analysis reveal that these preference perspectives fall into four groups of similar preferences.\r\n",

We present techniques that use automatic feature analysis, such as slide detection and applause detection, to help locate the desired video and to navigate to regions of interest within it. We built a web-based interface that graphically presents information about the contents of each video in a collection such as its keyframes and the distribution of a particular feature over time. A media player is tightly integrated with the web interface. It supports navigation within a selected file by visualiz-ing confidence scores for the presence of features and by using them as index points. We conducted a user study to refine the usability of these tools.",

One reason for printing documents is to annotate them with freeform ink while reading. Annotation can help readers to understand documents and to make them their own. In addition, annotation can reveal readers' interests with respect to a particular document. In particular, it is possible to construct full-text queries based on annotated passages of documents. We describe an experiment that tested the effectiveness of such queries, as compared to relevance feedback query techniques. For a set of TREC topics and documents, queries derived from annotated passages produced significantly better results than queries derived from subjects' judgments of relevance. ",

This paper describes the reading practices of an on-going reading group, and how these practices changed when we introduced XLibris, a digital library reading appliance that uses a pen tablet computer to provide a paper-like interface. We interviewed group members about their reading practices, observed their meetings, and analyzed their annotations, both when they read a paper document and when they read using XLibris. We use these data to characterize their analytic reading, reference use, and annotation practices. We also describe the use of the Reader's Notebook, a list of clippings that XLibris computes from a reader's annotations. Implications for digital libraries stem from our findings on reading and mobility, the complexity of analytic reading, the social nature of reference following, and the unselfconscious nature of readers' annotations.",

Cover sheets are commonly strewn around printer rooms; with interactivity, they can let people see what others have to say, add their own comments, or play games, all while waiting for their print jobs. We designed three prototype applications and deployed them briefly in our research lab. We found that interactive cover sheets can be very appealing, that the sheets must be designed so that people can still identify these pages as cover sheets, and that the slow interaction cycle favors asynchronous applications.

The Palette uses index cards that are printed with slide content that is easily identified by both humans and computers. The presenter controls the presentation by directly manipulating the cards. The Palette design is based on our observation of presentations given in a real work setting. Our experiences using the system are described, including new practices (e.g., collaborative presentation, enhanced notetaking) that arise from the affordances of this new approach. This system is an example of a new interaction paradigm called tacit interaction that supports users who can spare very little attention to a computer interface. ",

    "Title": "NotePals: Lightweight Note Sharing by the Group, for the Group.",
    "Abstract": "NotePals is a lightweight note sharing system that gives group members easy access to each other's experiences through their personal notes. The system allows notes taken by group members in any context to be uploaded to a shared repository. Group members view these notes with browsers that allow them to retrieve all notes taken in a given context or to access notes from other related notes or documents. This is possible because NotePals records the context in which each note is created (e.g., its author, subject, and creation time). The system is \"lightweight\" because it fits easily into group members' regular note-taking practices, and uses informal, ink-based user interfaces that run on portable, inexpensive hardware. In this paper we describe NotePals, show how we have used it to share our notes, and present our evaluations of the system. \r\n",

When decimated in time and reduced using truncation or principal component analysis, transform coefficients taken across an entire frame image allow rapid modeling, segmentation, and similarity calculation. Unlike color-histogram metrics, this approach models image composition and works on grayscale images. Modeling the statistics of the transformed video frame images gives a likelihood measure that allows video to be segmented, classified, and ranked by similarity for retrieval. Experiments are presented that show an 87% correct classification rate for different classes. Applications are presented including a content-aware video browser. ",

By calculating a measure of shot importance video can be summarized by de-emphasizing or discarding less important information, such as repeated or common scenes. In contrast to other approaches that present keyframes for each shot, this measure allows summarization by presenting only the most important shots. Selected keyframes can also be resized depending on their relative importance. We present an efficient packing algorithm that constructs a pictorial representation from differently-sized keyframes. This results in a compact and visually pleasing summary reminiscent of a comic book. ",

    "Abstract": "This paper describes a method for finding segments in video-recorded meetings that correspond to presentations. These segments serve as indexes into the recorded meeting. The system automatically detects intervals of video that correspond to presentation slides. We assume that only one person speaks during an interval when slides are detected. Thus these intervals can be used as training data for a speaker spotting system. An HMM is automatically constructed and trained on the audio data from each slide interval. A Viterbi alignment then resegments the audio according to speaker. Since the same speaker may talk across multiple slide intervals, the acoustic data from these intervals is clustered to yield an estimate of the number of distinct speakers and their order. This allows the individual presentations in the video to be identified from the location of each presenter's speech. Results are presented for a corpus of six meeting videos. \r\n",

    "Abstract": "In many hierarchical companies, reports from several independent groups must be merged to form a single, company-wide report. This paper describes a process and system for creating and structuring such reports and for propagating contributions up the organization. The system has been in regular use, in-house, by about 30 users for over a year to create monthly status reports. Our experiences indicate that it is possible to change a monthly reporting practice so that the system is easy to use, improves the quality of the written report, fosters collaboration across projects and creates a corporate memory for the company. These results were achieved as a consequence of our design effort to directly support the hierarchical and collaborative process of creating and assembling the report within the organization. User feedback has led to many improvements in the usability and functionality of the system. Further enhancements using information retrieval and text summarization techniques are in progress. \r\n",

    "Title": "The Genre of Mathematics Documents and its Implications for Digital Documents.",
    "Abstract": "The genre of mathematics writing has several distinctive features that point to some of the weaknesses of current digital documents. Some of these weaknesses are surprising. While it might be expected that the importance of formatting and special symbols in mathematics writing would pose challenges for digital documents, the linked, chunked style of mathematics writing, with its Theorems, Lemmas, Corollaries and Remarks explicitly referring to each other, resembles standard hypertext so closely that one would expect that mathematics writing would take well to online hypertext form. It does not. This failure points to deficiencies in our understanding of the true strengths and weaknesses of digital documents. This paper describes mathematics writing, with particular emphasis on features of interest with respect to digital documents. The difficulties in producing effective digital mathematics documents are then examined and used as a basis for talking about general challenges for digital documents. The paper then discusses strengths of digital documents and some of the problems that need to be overcome before digital documents can live up to claims made for them. It also examines some of the misguided claims, such as superior support for non-linearity, that are commonly made for digital documents, explains why these claims are unwarranted, and speculates on why the claims have been made anyway. Suggestions are then given as to what the true benefits of digitization are, including performing computations on text, flexible control of time, and better support for hiding information. The paper concludes with a list of questions whose answers are critical to understanding the capabilities, and therefore the future, of digital documents.\r\n",

    "Abstract": "This is a critical view of the hypothesis that better access to a broader repertoire of media resources will significantly enhance our ability to communicate more effectively. It begins by laying down a foundation of some basic principles concerning the nature of knowledge creation. This foundation is framed in a manner that involves the potential relevance of two particularly creative activities, storytelling and making jazz. This foundation provides the basis for a critical examination of several media-rich presentations that were delivered at the Institute for the Future Outlook Exchange in November of 1997, since these presentations actually pertained to the practices of digital storytelling and jamming. This critique is followed by a more detailed examination of what we may learn from jazz if we wish to invoke it as a metaphor for knowledge creation. The report then concludes by discussing the implications of these observations for a new world of work experiences in which knowledge creation is a critical element.",

    "Title": "Time-Constrained Keyframe Selection Technique.",
    "Abstract": "In accessing large collections of digitized videos, it is often difficult to find both the appropriate video file and the portion of the video that is of interest. This paper describes a novel technique for determining keyframes that are different from each other and provide a good representation of the whole video. We use keyframes to distinguish videos from each other, to summarize videos, and to provide access points into them. The technique can determine any number of keyframes by clustering the frames in a video and by selecting a representative frame from each cluster. Temporal constraints are used to filter out some clusters and to determine the representative frame for a cluster. Desirable visual features can be emphasized in the set of keyframes. An application for browsing a collection of videos makes use of the keyframes to support skimming and to provide visual summaries. \r\n\r\n",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we describe a technique for dynamically grouping digital ink and audio to support user interaction in freeform note-taking systems. For ink, groups of strokes might correspond to words, lines, or paragraphs of handwritten text. For audio, groups might be a complete spoken phrase or a speaker turn in a conversation. Ink and audio grouping is important for editing operations such as deleting or moving chunks of ink and audio notes. The grouping technique is based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering. This clustering algorithm yields groups of ink or audio in a range of sizes, depending on the level in the hierarchy, and thus provides structure for simple interactive selection and rapid non-linear expansion of a selection. Ink and audio grouping is also important for marking portions of notes for subsequent browsing and retrieval. Integration of the ink and audio clusters provides a flexible way to browse the notes by selecting the ink cluster and playing the corresponding audio cluster. ",

    "Abstract": "Although digital libraries are intended to support education and knowledge work, current digital library interfaces are narrowly focused on retrieval. Furthermore, they are designed for desktop computers with keyboards, mice, and high-speed network connections. Desktop computers fail to support many key aspects of knowledge work, including active reading, free form ink annotation, fluid movement among document activities, and physical mobility. This paper proposes portable computers specialized for knowledge work, or digital library information appliances, as a new platform for accessing digital libraries. We present a number of ways that knowledge work can be augmented and transformed by the use of such appliances. These insights are based on our implementation of two research prototype systems: XLibris,â„¢ an \"active reading machine,\" and TeleWeb, a mobile World Wide Web browser.",

    "Abstract": "\"Linking by inking\" is a new interface for reader-directed link construction that bridges reading and browsing activities. We are developing linking by inking in XLibris,â„¢ a hypertext system based on the paper document metaphor. Readers use a pen computer to annotate page images with free-form ink, much as they would on paper, and the computer constructs hypertext links based on the ink marks. This paper proposes two kinds of reader-directed links: automatic and manual. Automatic links are created in response to readers' annotations. The system extracts the text near free-form ink marks, uses these terms to construct queries, executes queries against a collection of documents, and unobtrusively displays links to related documents in the margin or as \"further reading lists.\" We also present a design for manual (ad hoc) linking: circling an ink symbol generates a multi-way link to other instances of the same symbol.

    "Abstract": "This paper describes a technique for segmenting video using hidden Markov models (HMM). Video is segmented into regions defined by shots, shot boundaries, and camera movement within shots. Features for segmentation include an image-based distance between adjacent video frames, an audio distance based on the acoustic difference in intervals just before and after the frames, and an estimate of motion between the two frames. Typical video segmentation algorithms classify shot boundaries by computing an image-based distance between adjacent frames and comparing this distance to fixed, manually determined thresholds. Motion and audio information is used separately. In contrast, our segmentation technique allows features to be combined within the HMM framework. Further, thresholds are not required since automatically trained HMMs take their place. This algorithm has been tested on a video data base, and has been shown to improve the accuracy of video segmentation over standard threshold-based systems. ",

This combination of reading with critical thinking and learning is called active reading [2]. To explore the premise that computation can enhance active reading we have built the XLibrisâ„¢ \"active reading machine.\" XLibrisâ„¢ uses a commercial high-resolution pen tablet display along with a paper-like user interface to support the key affordances of paper for active reading: the reader can hold a scanned image of a page in his lap and mark on it with digital ink. To go beyond paper, XXLibrisâ„¢ monitors the free-form ink annotations made while reading, and uses these to organize and to search for information. Readers can review, sort and filter clippings of their annotated text in a \"Reader's Notebook.\" XLibrisâ„¢ also searches for material related to the annotated text, and displays links to similar documents unobtrusively in the margin. XLibrisâ„¢ demonstrates that computers can help active readers organize and find information while retaining many of the advantages of reading on paper.",

Segmentation is the partitioning of continuous media into homogenous regions. Retrieval is performed over segments of the media using the annotations associated with the segments. We present two scenarios that describe how these techniques might be applied. In the first, we describe how excerpts from a video-taped usage study of a new device are located for inclusion in a report on the utility of the device.

    "Title": "AESOP: An Outline-Oriented Authoring System",
    "Abstract": "Because a hypermedia document is more complex than conventional text, it requires preparation with respect to two key aspects. First, the author begins to develop a \"vision\" of the document-usually based on some outline-level description of his objectives. At the same time, as this outline is being developed, the author begins to extract useful segments from his resource materials and prepares his first version of the logic of a system of hyperlinks among those segments. In this paper we present a system named \"Authoring Environment for the deSktOP\" (AESOP) with two different types of \"outlining\" tools to handle these aspects. Planning the \"vision\" consists in defining a \"logical\" tree structure of the document. The plan for the link structure is based on a primitive unit called the view area, and AESOP provides a construct named Bento-Box for creating and manipulating view areas. Authors specify spatial and temporal layout within a single Bento-Box and define hyperlinks among the Bento-Boxes.\r\n",

    "Title": "Indexing the Content of Multimedia Documents.",
    "Abstract": "As the concept of what constitutes a \"content-based\" search grows more mature, it becomes valuable for us to establish a clear sense of just what is meant by \"content.\" Recent multimedia document retrieval systems have dealt with this problem by indexing across multiple indexes; but it is important to identify how such multiple indexes are dealing with multiple dimensions of a description space, rather than simply providing the user with more descriptors. In this paper we consider a description space for multimedia documents based on three \"dimensions\" of a document, namely context, form, and content. We analyze the nature of this space with respect to three challenging examples of multimedia search tasks, and we address the nature of the index structures that would facilitate how these tasks may be achieved. These examples then lead us to some general conclusions on the nature of multimedia indexing and the intuitions we have inherited from the tradition of books and libraries. ",

But what if the revolution materializes and no users show up? We were confronted with this question when we began deploying and studying the use of a video-based, background awareness application within our organization. Repeatedly, new users raised strong concerns about self-presentation, surveillance, privacy, video snapshots, and lack of audience cues. We describe how we addressed these concerns by evolving the application. As a consequence, we are also redesigning the user interface to the application. ",

    "Abstract": "The phenomenal interest and growth of the World Wide Web as an application server has pushed the Web model to its limits. Specifically, the Web offers limited interactivity and versatility as a platform for networked applications. One major challenge for the HCI community is to determine how to improve the human-computer interface for Web-based applications. This paper focuses on a significant Web deficiency - supporting truly interactive and dynamic form-based input. We propose a well-worked form interaction abstraction that alleviates this Web deficiency. We describe how the abstraction is seamlessly integrated into the Web framework by leveraging on the virtues of the Web and fitting within the interaction and usage model of the Web.",

    "Abstract": "The newspaper represents a mature information presentation medium that is well-suited to the presentation of relatively short, loosely related pieces of text. This work examines the implementation of the newspaper metaphor in an information exploration interface. Based on an analysis of differences between electronic books and electronic newspapers, we submit that the newspaper metaphor is an appropriate interface paradigm for large-scale full-text databases. Similarities between newspapers and hypertext databases lead us to suggest that this metaphor is appropriate for large automatically-generated hypertexts, independent of the nature of their content. We describe VOIR, a software prototype that we have used as an electronic newspaper workbench. The program constructs newspaper pages interactively, and allows users to specify their information-seeking intent in a variety of ways, including graphical Boolean queries, hypertext links, and typed-in queries. Finally, we discuss some implications that this work has for hypertext and information retrieval in general. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "Abstract": "This paper addresses the issue of how research methodology can be developed for the specific needs of research into information exploration behavior, based on a four year program of research on individual strategies in information exploration. We propose a meta-experimental framework where research is carried out through a dynamic interaction between what and why questions, and between confirmatory and exploratory analyses. This approach preserves many of the advantages of formal experimentation, while permitting a more holistic examination of phenomena that is characteristic of ethnography. The application of the meta-theoretical framework is illustrated in three case studies that examined new information exploration functionalities and interfaces and their relationship to expertise and exploration strategy.\r\n",

From the more conventional point of view, the hypertext document is discussed with respect to the four areas analyzed by Barthes: the distinction between language and speech, the relationship between the signifier and the signified, the syntagmatic and associative relationships among signs, and the hierarchical embedding of signs through connotation and metalanguage. The second examination is a hypertext document designed in such a way that the reader may EXPERIENCE Barthes' elements of semiology, rather than serve as a passive receiver of his exposition. The result is an interactive environment in its own right, entitled \"Signs and Links,\" that, through the experience of interaction, engages the reader in the definition of the conceptual space of Barthes' text.",

    "Abstract": "Traditionally hypertexts have been limited in size by the manual effort required to create hypertext links. In addition, large hyper-linked collections may overwhelm users with the range of possible links from any node, only a fraction of which may be appropriate for a given user at any time. This work explores automatic methods of link construction based on feedback from users collected during browsing. A full-text search engine mediates the linking process. Query terms that distinguish well among documents in the database become candidate anchors; links are mediated by passage-based relevance feedback queries. The newspaper metaphor is used to organize the retrieval results.\r\n\r\nVOIR, a software prototype that implements these algorithms has been used to browse a 74,500 node (250MB) database of newspaper articles. An experiment has been conducted to test the relative effectiveness of dynamic links and user-specified queries. Experimental results suggest that link-mediated queries are more effective than user-specified queries in retrieving relevant information. The paper concludes with a discussion of possible extensions to the linking algorithms.\r\n",

The prohibitively expensive link creation effort, however, prevents traditional hypertext interfaces from being used with large coherent collections of text. Such collections typically require query-based interfaces. This paper examines a hybrid approach: the system described here creates anchors dynamically based on users' queries, and uses anchor selection as a query expansion mechanism. An experiment was conducted to compare browsing behavior in query- and link-based interfaces. Results suggest that query-mediated links are as effective as explicit queries, and that strategies adopted by users affect performance. This work has implications for the design of information exploration interfaces; the dynamic link algorithms described here are being incorporated into a Web server.",

    "Abstract": "In this chapter, we discuss mixed-media access, an information access paradigm for multimedia data in which the media type of a query may differ from that of the data. This allows a single query to be used to retrieve information from data consisting of multiple types of media. In addition, multiple queries formulated in different media types can be used to more accurately specify the data to be retrieved. The types of media considered in this paper are speech, images of text, and full-length text. Some examples of metadata for mixed-media access are locations of keywords in speech and images, identification of speakers, locations of emphasized regions in speech, and locations of topic boundaries in text. Algorithms for automatically generating this metadata are described, including word spotting, speaker segmentation, emphatic speech detection, and subtopic boundary location. We illustrate the use of mixed-media access with an example of information access from multimedia data surrounding a formal presentation. \r\n",

    "Title": "Text Types in Hypermedia.",
    "Abstract": "The discipline of narratology has long recognized the need to classify documents as instances of different text types. We have discovered that classification is as applicable to hypermedia as it is to any other document presentation. Following the work of S. Chatman (1978; 1990), we consider three such text types: description, argument and narrative. The goal of a description document is to describe some object or concept; this is usually achieved by describing component parts and then describing how those parts combine to constitute the entirety. An argument document, on the other hand, is concerned with establishing some assertion or point of view, and it is based on supporting evidence, as well as possible refutations and justifications for defeating those regulations. Finally, a narrative document recounts some sequence of events in time, addressing relationships such as causality and contingency among those events. We analyze these types through case studies that give an example of each as a hypermedia document. We then argue that this classification provides an organizational framework that facilitates the construction of outlines that serve the writer in preparing the actual content of a document. Such outlines can also benefit the reader's understanding of the content that the writer intended to convey; if the writer does not make those outlines available explicitly to the reader, the reader can use knowledge of the document type to construct his own version of those outlines. Finally, we review some early work in content based indexing and search of multimedia documents",

    "Title": "Representing the Content of Video: Artifact or Process? ",
    "Abstract": "An approach to semantics based on traditional paradigms of knowledge representation (e.g., developing reductionist models of video document genres), while not entirely of the mark, may be significantly misdirected. Understanding the semantics of video and multimedia must begin with understanding how video (and film) are \"read\" and \"written.\" The purpose of this paper is to set an agenda for coming to an understanding of reading and writing multimedia and to address the representationalist implications of achieving that end. Further, we illustrate this research agenda, showing how we have applied concepts and methods from film theory (to the reading process) and interaction analysis (to the work of multimedia production), and what our preliminary findings might mean for computational support and knowledge representation in multimedia.",

    "Abstract": "We have developed a technique that categorizes document images based on their content. Unlike conventional methods that use optical character recognition (OCR), we convert document images into word shape takens, a shape-based representation of words. Because we have only to recognize simple graphical features from image, this process is much faster than OCR. Although the mapping between word shape tokens and words is one-to-many, they are a rich source of information for content characterization. Using a vector space classifier with a scanned document image database, we show that the word shape token-based approach is quite adequate for content-oriented categorization in terms of accuracy compared with conventional OCR-based approaches.",

    "Abstract": "The fundamental objective of Extended Media research is the empowering of documents through technology. We see our goal as that of inventing documents which communicate more effectively. Furthermore, we need to make it easier for the writer to record what must be communicated and for the reader to access it. Thus, we anticipate that one cannot invent new documents without also inventing new processes for both writing and reading. Our primary research thrust is thus in the authoring of hypermedia documents, supplemented by a secondary thrust concerned with the problem of managing archives and libraries where more than text is involved.",

    "Abstract": "Online digital audio is a rapidly growing resource, which can be accessed in rich new ways not previously possible. For example, it is possible to listen to just those portions of a long discussion which involve a given subset of people, or to instantly skip ahead to the next speaker. Providing this capability to users, however, requires generation of necessary indices, as well as an interface which utilizes these indices to aid navigation.\r\n\r\nWe describe algorithms which generate indices from automatic acoustic segmentation. These algorithms use hidden Markov models to segment audio into segments corresponding to different speakers or acoustics classes (e.g. music). Unsupervised model initialization using agglomerative clustering is described, and shown to work as well in most cases as supervised initialization.\r\n\r\nWe also describe a user interface which displays the segmentation in the form of a timeline, which tracks for the different acoustic classes. The interface can be used for direct navigation through the audio.\r\n\r\n",

    "Title": " Integrating Information via Matchmaking",
    "Abstract": "Trends such as the massive increase in information available via electronic networks, the use of on-line product data by distributed concurrent engineering teams, and dynamic supply chain integration for electronic commerce are placing severe burdens on traditional methods of information sharing and retrieval. Sources of information are far too numerous and dynamic to be found via traditional information retrieval methods, and potential consumers are seeing increased need for automatic notification services. Matchmaking is an approach based on emerging information integration technologies whereby potential producers and consumers of information send messages describing their information capabilities and needs. These descriptions, represented in rich, machine-interpretable description languages, are unified by the matchmaker to identify potential matches. Based on the matches, a variety of information brokering services are performed. We introduce matchmaking, and argue that it permits large numbers of dynamic consumers and providers, operating on rapidly-changing data, to share information more effectively than via traditional methods. Two matchmakers are described, the SHADE matchmaker, which operates over logical and structured text languages, and the COINS matchmaker, which operates over free text. These matchmakers have been used for a variety of applications, most significantly, in the domains of engineering and electronic commerce. We describe our experiences with the SHADE and COINS matchmaker, and we outline the major observed benefits and problems of matchmaking.",

    "Title": "Issues and Extensions for Information Matchmaking Protocols",
    "Abstract": "As agents see more use in dynamic, distributed information networks, information sharing facilitators, such as the SHADE matchmaker, and underlying knowledge-based agent communication protocols, such as the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language, will see increased use. We have created several communities of agents collaborating via KQML and matchmaking within the domains of collaborative engineering and satellite image retrieval. Based on these experiences, matchmaking has proven to be very beneficial for multi-agent systems, but we have also identified a number of issues and extensions that are not only vital to KQML-based matchmaking, but to inter-agent protocols in general. These include representational approaches to advertising complex databases, approaches to error recovery and response timing, maintaining consistency among information providers, scalability, security, persistent requests in information brokering, and the dilemma between explicit vs. implicit brokering.",

    "Title": "Multimedia Document System for Temporal and Spatial Structuring",
    "Abstract": "Structuring temporal relationships among multimedia information elements is one of the most important facilities for editing and creating multimedia documents. We have developed a multimedia system named MediaPreview which provides facilities for structuring and creating multimedia documents. In this paper, we present a document model which is adopted in MediaPreview. This model has been designed to realize spatial and temporal structuring for the documents. The main feature of this model is the concept of a \"Multimedia Paragraph\" (MMP) which is introduced to reduce the complexity of the temporal structuring, such as the asynchronous interactive operation among documents. The concept of \"MMP\" provides an explicit and basic unit which is used to create a document in a \"top-down\" manner. \r\n\r\nThis paper also presents the system architecture and implementation of MediaPreview in a distributed environment including database system facilities. This system realizes \"static\" and \"dynamic\" integration schemes for multimedia information elements. Our system includes a parallel database engine which manipulates multimedia information elements as streams. This database engine is effectively used for creating multimedia documents.\r\n",
